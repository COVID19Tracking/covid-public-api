Positives sometimes update before totals do. \nTotal includes Oregon residents tested in Idaho.  \n\nAs of April 9, Idaho separately reports both probable and confirmed cases. Idaho reports test counts in specimens. \n\nOn June 5, Idaho received a large batch of previously unreported tests.\n\nOn July 3, ID revised down the Recovered number by about 1,500 noting that \"an error in auto-calculation was discovered.\"\n\nOn July 8, ID revised historical hospitalization, on July 17 we updated those values for March 23 - July 15, carrying forward current values until information is updated.\n\nOn July 22, ID reported 126 total deaths but also reported 103 lab-confirmed deaths and 33 probable deaths. We believe that the correct number of probable deaths is 23 and that 33 was a mistake. We therefore report 126 total deaths in ID for this date. See ID state page screenshots for July 22. \n\nOn August 4, Idaho reported current hospitalizations of 106, down from the previous report of 223 on July 31.
