ID,"Negative = Totals - Positives.  Positives sometimes update before totals do. 
Total includes Oregon residents tested in Idaho.  

As of April 9, Idaho separately reports both probable and confirmed cases. Idaho reports test counts in specimens. 

On June 5, Idaho received a large batch of previously unreported tests.

On July 3, ID revised down the Recovered number by about 1,500 noting that ""an error in auto-calculation was discovered.""

On July 8, ID revised historical hospitalization, on July 17 we updated those values for March 23 - July 15, carrying forward current values until information is updated.

On July 22, ID reported 126 total deaths but also reported 103 lab-confirmed deaths and 33 probable deaths. We believe that the correct number of probable deaths is 23 and that 33 was a mistake. We therefore report 126 total deaths in ID for this date. See ID state page screenshots for July 22.
