{"state":"PA","notes":"On January 28, 2021, Pennsylvania [noted](https://www.media.pa.gov/pages/health-details.aspx?newsid=1273) that their case counts included backlogged antigen testing data from urgent care centers collected over a week ago. Pennsylvania will continue to report this data over the next few days, which will in turn affect our reported case counts.\n\nOn January 4, 2021, Pennsylvania [announced](https://www.media.pa.gov/pages/health-details.aspx?newsid=1231) \"3,226 additional positive cases of COVID-19, in addition to 4,579 new cases reported Sunday, January 3 for a two-day total of 8,992 additional positive cases of COVID-19.\" In addition, case counts for January 4, 2021 are \"atypically low\" due to technical maintenance.\n\nOn December 28, 2020, Pennsylvania's Total PCR tests (specimens) value increased by ~690,000 from 7,202,533 tests to 7,892,184 tests.

We were unable to find an explanation for this fluctuation.\n\nOn December 14, 2020, Pennsylvaniaâ€™s **Total PCR tests (specimens)** decreased by roughly 297k without explanation.\n\nOn September 3, 2020, Pennsylvania [clarified](https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx) that the test numbers they have been reporting previously are in units of unique people and began publishing new test data in units of specimens. On September 4, 2020, we therefore moved the appropriate historical data to the **Total tests (people)** field and began capturing **Total PCR tests (specimens)**. \n\nOn April 23, 2020, Pennsylvania revised down its total **Deaths (confirmed and probable)** from 1,622 to 1,421 to exclude some probable deaths that needed further confirmation to be linked to COVID-19","covid19Site":"https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Cases.aspx","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://padoh.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/5662e22517b644ba874ca51fa7b61c94","covid19SiteTertiary":null,"covid19SiteQuaternary":null,"covid19SiteQuinary":null,"twitter":"@PAHealthDept","covid19SiteOld":"https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"People","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"totalTestsPeopleViral","totalTestResultsField":"posNeg","pui":"Only positives","pum":false,"name":"Pennsylvania","fips":"42"}
