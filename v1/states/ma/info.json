{"state":"MA","notes":"MA reports both the number of tests performed and the number of people tested. Both data points are available in our API, but MA data on our web pages is reported in units of people tested. \n\nOn June 1, MA began to release probable cases and deaths, causing total cases and total deaths to spike in our data. \n\nOn June 30, MA decreased the number of cumulative hospitalization, confirmed and probable deaths \"due to ongoing data cleaning which identifies and removes duplicate reports.\"\n\nOn July 31, MA noted that \"Delays in the reporting of test results to DPH from multiple laboratories, including large national commercial laboratories, are reflected in todayâ€™s case counts. However, these positive test results have been assigned retrospectively to the appropriate date of test.\" We will backfill our own case counts for MA as soon as possible.\n\nOn August 5, MA did not publish data by our collection time. A note on their site said \"Significant IT issues are impacting the production of today's data report. It will be posted as soon as it is available.\"\n\nOn August 12, MA began reporting probable cases weekly, not daily. This can lead to apparent spikes in the data when the weekly numbers are incorporated. MA reports total case counts of both confirmed and probable cases daily in its race and ethnicity data.\n\n\n","covid19Site":"https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-cases-quarantine-and-monitoring","covid19SiteSecondary":"","covid19SiteTertiary":"","twitter":"@massdph","covid19SiteOld":"https://www.mass.gov/resource/information-on-the-outbreak-of-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19","name":"Massachusetts","fips":"25","pui":"","pum":false}
