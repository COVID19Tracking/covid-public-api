We include data for Florida non-residents in our deaths and hospitalizations figures but not in cases and tests. For some metrics, we use machine queries against the Florida Department of Health's raw data, which may not be displayed on its [dashboard](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/96dd742462124fa0b38ddedb9b25e429/).\n\n[Per reporting](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241882491.html), the number of **pending tests** (available in our API and CSVs) may include only results from public labs, and may therefore be an undercount.\n\nOn November 3, 2020, Florida’s **Positive PCR Tests (specimens)** dropped by over 200 with no explanation.\n\nOn October 30, 2020, the number of negative residents ('T_NegRes') remained unchanged on Florida's ArcGIS layer. The number of unique people tested in 'totalTestsPeopleViral' draws from 'T_NegRes' and 'C_AllResTypes' fields on Florida's ArcGIS layer. \n\nOn October 26, 2020, Florida started providing a full timeseries of total test encounters excluding tests from individuals after they test positive. We started capturing this data in our `totalTestEncountersViral` field. As of October 27, 2020, Florida's total test results are also drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via the number of unique individuals testing positive and negative. The number of unique people tested, now drawn from the `T_NegRes` and `C_AllResTypes` values on Florida's ArcGIS layer, is still available in `totalTestsPeopleViral`. The new encounters time-series only reflects Florida residents, so we have also revised our existing cases figures and unique individuals tested figure to reflect only residents. These changes resulted in a 1.28% decrease in Florida's cases and a 0.38% decrease in Florida's unique people tested.\n\nOn October 21, 2020, only some of Florida's data updated by our publication time. Data points such as **Total PCR Tests (People)** did not update.\n\nAs of October 13, 2020, Florida's Antigen positive timeseries is stored in our **Probable cases** field, reflecting a response to our outreach to Florida's health department that it switches Antigen positive cases to PCR positive cases in their daily state report upon confirmatory PCR testing.\n\nOn October 10, 2020, Florida did not report COVID-19 data. The state initially reported that this was because Helix Laboratory, a private lab, submitted 400,000 previously submitted results, which required extra deduplication time. On October 12, 2020, [the Florida Department of Health announced](http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/10/101220-1127-covid19.pr.html) that the error was not the fault of the private lab, but was due to \"an unforeseen technical issue\" that was \"not the fault of Helix or the Department of Health.\" The state's data for October 11, 2020 appears to include data from both October 10 and 11.\n\nOn September 1, 2020, the Florida Department of Health [announced](http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/09/090120-1112-covid19.pr.html) that Quest Diagnostics had reported nearly 75,000 backlogged tests dating as far back as April.\n\nOn August 14, 2020, Florida began distinguishing between people with positive antigen tests and people with positive PCR tests in the Total Cases number given in their daily state report. As of September 30, 2020, we have removed these antigen positives from the values for **Cases or Positive PCR tests (people)** (_positiveCasesViral_ in our API), so the values for this metric in our time series will be lower. **Cases (confirmed plus probable)** (_positive_ in our API) will be unaffected.\n\nOn August 12, 2020, the Florida Department of Health reported via Twitter that it had received a large backlog of testing data from Niznik Lab Corp in Miami: \"The lab reported over 4,000 cases occurring over the last 7 weeks, but which had not been reported to FDOH until today. Therefore, this backlog severely skews today's daily report for Miami-Dade and is not reflective of current trends.\"\n\nAs of July 10, 2020, Florida reports **Now hospitalized** data for those patients with a \"primary diagnosis of COVID-19.\"\n\nSince May 15, 2020, Florida reports total tests in unique people and in unique people tested per lab. For that latter number, if an individual is tested twice by one lab, they only get counted once, but if an individual gets tested twice at different labs, they get counted twice. We store the former value in **Total PCR Tests (People)**, and the latter value, which does not match any of our totals units, in **Total Tests (PCR)**, our specimens field, where we also store testing data with unclear units. This value does **not** represent the number of specimens.\n\nOn March 21, 2020, Florida began including tests of people not investigated as PUIs in its **Negative PCR tests** metric.

According to the [state dashboard annotation](https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases), the \"Hospitalized with COVID\" figure describes those whose main reason for hospitalization is COVID-19, and it also includes all those who are \"Hospitalized due to COVID\". We are using the \"Hospitalized with COVID\" figure for our **Currently hospitalized** and **Currently in ICU** metrics, however there are not matching Cumulative metrics so we are using the \"Due to COVID\" Cumulative hospitalized and ICU figures.\n\nOn November 12, 2020, North Dakota explained that higher than normal fluctuations may be seen in data from the week of November 9, 2020, due to a software issue which has been resolved.\n\nOn November 12, 2020, North Dakota [announced](https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases) that the high number of tests and positives was due in part to 5600 test backlog experienced by a third-party lab.\n\nOn November 11, 2020, North Dakota reported two days of data for all metrics except for Total PCR tests (specimens), Positive PCR tests (people), and Positive cases (confirmed + probable).\n\nOn November 10, 2020, North Dakota reported that their software for hospitalization metrics was down, an issue which also impacts active cases. We updated Total PCR tests (specimens), Positive PCR tests (people), and Positive cases (confirmed + probable) from their [daily news release](https://www.health.nd.gov/news/covid-19-test-results-0).\n\nAs of September 11, 2020, North Dakota’s total test results reflect total test encounters. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as `totalTestsPeopleViral`.\n\nOn September 9, 2020, North Dakota began reporting “Susceptible Encounters” on its dashboard, which are defined as test encounters excluding those who have tested positive after the first time. We have begun recording the value in our **Total PCR tests (test encounters)** field.\n\nOn August 19, 2020, North Dakota launched a new dashboard with a number of new data points, including race and ethnicity data and ICU data. \n\nOn May 3, 2020, North Dakota began reporting two additional **death** metrics: deaths of people with lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 whose death records are still pending and deaths of people with lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 whose death certificates do not list COVID-19 as a cause of death. As of July 1, 2020, we have edited our historical figures to exclude these numbers from our death counts, resulting in an apparent drop from 24 deaths on May 2 to 16 on May 3.
