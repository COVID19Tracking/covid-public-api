[{"state":"AK","notes":"Alaska combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard.\n\nOn January 20, 2021, Alaska [reported](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2021/01/20/tracking-covid-19-in-alaska-record-23-deaths-and-167-infections-reported-wednesday/) a comparatively large increase of 23 deaths due to a review of death certificates.\n\nOn January 4, 2020, Alaska noted that \"counted deaths in Alaska include COVID-19 cases confirmed through a lab result as well as probable deaths based on confirmed COVID-19 clinical and epidemiological criteria as defined by the CDC with no confirmatory lab testing.\" Due to this change we are unable to update the **Confirmed deaths** metric after January 4, 2020.\n\nOn January 1, 2021, Alaska noted that there would be no update to their data on January 1, 2021.\n\nOn December 25, 2020, Alaska announced on their dashboard that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020. \n\nOn November 17, 2020, Alaska [announced](https://alaska-coronavirus-vaccine-outreach-alaska-dhss.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/cases-frequently-asked-questions) that “As of 11/17/2020, the cases dashboard will not be showing data on recovered and active cases due to the increasing State case load”. Due to this we cannot continue reporting **Recovered**, however the time series for this metric is available in the historical data, and our data downloads. \n\nOn November 16, 2020 we updated the **Total cases** field to include only residents. We also deleted the time series for **Confirmed cases** because Alaska is lumping PCR and antigen testing for their case definition.\n\nOn November 16, 2020 we added **Cumulative Hospitalized** (which includes both residents and non-residents), although the value does not reflect current hospitalizations.\n\nOn November 7, 2020, Alaska announced that their testing dashboard would be \"temporarily disabled from November 6th to November 9th\" and that testing data could be accessed through their data summary tables. After originally using the data summary tables on November 7, we have reversed that decision, and reverted the values to their November 6th state. The frozen values were replaced on November 10, with values from the state's [Tests Dataset](https://coronavirus-response-alaska-dhss.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/tests-dataset). \n\nOn November 6, 2020, Alaska’s **Total PCR tests (specimens)** and **Positive PCR tests (specimens)** decreased without explanation. As a result, `Negative`, which is calculated by subtracting **Total cases** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)**, decreased as well.\n\nOn November 5, 2020, Alaska’s **Total PCR tests (specimens)** increased from roughly 628k to 782k. We were unable to find an explanation for the increase.\n\nAs of September 18, 2020, Alaska's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.","covid19Site":"http://dhss.alaska.gov/dph/Epi/id/Pages/COVID-19/monitoring.aspx","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/ed1c874ca60b4c15ab09095a070065ca","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://alaska-dhss.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/8782a14ef52342e99f866a3b8a3e624a","covid19SiteQuaternary":"https://services1.arcgis.com/WzFsmainVTuD5KML/arcgis/rest/services/Tests_Dataset/FeatureServer/0/query?where=Test_Result+%3D+%27Negative%27&outStatistics=%5B%7B%27statisticType%27%3A+%27count%27%2C+%27onStatisticField%27%3A+%27FID%27%2C+%27outStatisticFieldName%27%3A+%27tests_negative%27%7D%5D","covid19SiteQuinary":"https://services1.arcgis.com/WzFsmainVTuD5KML/arcgis/rest/services/Tests_Dataset/FeatureServer/0/query?where=Test_Result+%3D+%27Positive%27&outStatistics=%5B%7B%27statisticType%27%3A+%27count%27%2C+%27onStatisticField%27%3A+%27FID%27%2C+%27outStatisticFieldName%27%3A+%27tests_positive%27%7D%5D","twitter":"@Alaska_DHSS","covid19SiteOld":"http://dhss.alaska.gov/dph/Epi/id/Pages/COVID-19/default.aspx","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Specimens","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"totalTestsViral","totalTestResultsField":"Total Tests (PCR)","pui":"All data","pum":false,"name":"Alaska","fips":"02"},{"state":"AL","notes":"Alabama combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard.\n\nNegative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.\n\nOn February 02, 2021, Alabama reported a large increase in Total antibody tests (people) of approximately 33,000 without explanation. Additionally, Total PCR tests (people) decreased by approximately 11,000 without explanation, resulting in a decrease in Negative PCR tests (people).\n\nOn January 30, 2021, Alabama noted on their data dashboard that due to maintenance and upgrades, the Alabama NEDSS Base System did not run on the evening of January 29, 2021, and as as result there would be no update to their dashboard on January 30, 2021. We were only able to update their Currently hospitalized and Ever hospitalized on January 30, 2021.\n\nOn January 22, 2021, Alabama noted that the Alabama Department of Public Health processed a backlog of 409 positive PCR tests dating back to November 19, 2020 through January 20, 2021, and that these tests would be included in their Confirmed cases and Cases (confirmed + probable) for January 22, 2021. As a result, not all new cases reported on January 22, 2021 were reported within the previous 24 hour period.\n\nOn January 13, 2021, Alabama reported that it is reviewing a large number of deaths from the Alabama Center for Health Statistics (ACHS), an endeavor which began on November 11, 2020 and will continue until further notice. As a result, death numbers during this time period reported may include historic deaths and may not accurately reflect new COVID-19 deaths. We urge caution when interpreting these numbers, and encourage the use of 7 and 14-day averages as more reliable metrics.\n\nOn January 5, 2021, Alabama noted on their COVID-19 dashboard that the cases reported on January 5, 2021 were high due to a delay in testing and reporting over the holiday weekend. On January 7, 2021, they noted that cases and deaths reported through the week of January 7, 2021, may be affected by holiday related reporting delays. We urge caution in using figures from this time period, and encourage the use of 7 and 14-day averages as more reliable metrics.\n\nOn December 18, 2020, Alabama announced that a backlog of 382 positive PCR test results from December 10, 2020 through December 13, 2020 will be classified as being reported on December 17, 2020.\n\nOn December 15, 2020, Alabama announced that a backlog of 59 positive PCR tests and 479 positive antigen tests from September 29, 2020 through December 14, 2020 would be included in their data for December 15, 2020.\n\nOn December 12, 2020, Alabama announced that they processed a backlog of 398 positive antigen tests from July 7, 2020 through December 9, 2020.  These positive tests will be reported in Alabama’s Probable Cases and Cases (confirmed + probable) on December 12, 2020.\n\nOn December 12, 2020 through December 13, 2020, Alabama did not update their testing data by the time of our daily update. As a result, we were unable to update Total antibody tests (people), Total PCR tests (people), and Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated from Total PCR tests (people) minus Confirmed cases.\n\nOn December 9, 2020, Alabama processed a backlog of positive PCR and antigen test results from October 5, 2020 through December 7, 2020. This backlog makes up roughly 10% of Cases (confirmed + probable) reported on December 10, 2020.\n\nOn December 3, 2020, Alabama announced that: \"The Alabama Department of Public Health processed two backlogs totaling 1038 positive PCR results and 473 positive antigen results from two facilities on December 7. These will be classified as 1038 confirmed cases and 473 probable cases reported on 12/08/20 even though the tests were performed during November 30 through December 5, 2020.\"\n\nAs of December 2, 2020, Alabama's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsPeopleViral` field instead of  `totalTestsViral`. Before that, as of September 18, 2020, Alabama's total test results were switched to draw from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of being calculated via positive+negative. The timeseries are the same, but previously, Alabama's units had been unclear, and therefore we stored the series in our specimens field. \n\nOn December 2, 2020, Alabama announced that a backlog of 706 positive PCR tests performed from November 23, 2020 through November 29, 2020 would be included in their daily update for December 2, 2020.\n\nOn December 1, 2020, Alabama [announced](https://twitter.com/alpublichealth/status/1333790272648409093?s=21) that increased new case and death counts are due to delayed data from Thanksgiving.\n\nOn November 25, 2020, Alabama announced that the Alabama Department of Public Health Infection Disease and Outbreak team reviewed their electronic disease surveillance system and “updated some parameters”. As a result, **Recovered** increased by roughly 71k on November 25, 2020.\n\nOn November 14, 2020, Alabama announced that a backlog of 109 positive antigen results would be reported as probable cases on November 14, 2020. As a result, new **Probable cases** reported on November 14, 2020 were not all reported in the previous 24 hour period.\n\nOn November 11, 2020, Alabama announced via their [dashboard](https://alpublichealth.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/6d2771faa9da4a2786a509d82c8cf0f7) that they have begun a review process for deaths from the Alabama Center for Health Statistics (ACHS). According to Alabama, at least half of the **Deaths (confirmed and probable)** reported today (81 in total) are from this review. More deaths may be added from this review in the coming days.\n\nOn November 10, 2020 Alabama’s **Total PCR tests (specimens)** decreased by roughly 700 without explanation.\n\nOn October 21, 2020, Alabama did not update their COVID-19 dashboard due to \"technical issues\".\n\nOn September 1, 2020, Alabama began displaying the number of people tested by antibody, over 50,000 individuals, separately from its main total tested field, which it clarified represents antigen and PCR testing. Its main total tested number dropped by over 25,000 the same day. We have reached out to the Alabama Department of Public Health to confirm this drop was due to the removal of the individuals tested by antibody.\n\nOn July 11, 2020, Alabama began using direct reports from hospitals for cumulative hospitalizations (which we report in our **Ever hospitalized** metric), rather than state case surveillance. Its number of cumulative hospitalizations increased by over 3,000 as a result.

Please exercise caution when looking at their data from this period and be aware that 7 day averages are a more reliable metric than individual figures.\n\nOn December 18, 2020, Delaware announced that due to laboratory reporting delays, the number of cases reported for December 17, 2020 is lower than previous days, and the number of cases reported for December 18, 2020 would be higher than previous days to make up for it. Because Delaware reports their data as of the previous day, this affects our data for December 18, 2020 and December 19, 2020.\n\nOn December 7, 2020, Delaware announced that they would no longer be reporting **Recovered** as it was “no longer a true reflection of the number of persons that recovered from the disease” because this metric included only cases who had self-reported their recovery to the Division of Public Health. Due to this we cannot continue reporting **Recovered**, however the time series for this metric is available in the historical data, and our data downloads. \n\nOn October 29, 2020, we moved the data in our **Total Tests (PCR)** field for Delaware to the **Total Test Encounters (PCR)** field after learning that it represents encounters from Delaware's state health department. However, Delaware appears to include antigen tests in its totals, so if an individual is tested using two different test types on the same day, it will get counted twice. Also as of October 29, 2020, Delaware's `totalTestResults` field represents encounters. The number of unique people ever tested remains available in the `totalTestsPeopleViral` field.  \n\nOn September 9, 2020, Delaware reported that  data from September 8, 2020 and September 9, 2020 would not be available until September 10, 2020 due to a maintenance issue with their electronic reporting system. We will backfill data for September 8, 2020 and September 9, 2020 to the best of our abilities when data is released\n\nOn September 6, 2020, the Division of Public Health reported a technical issue which caused between 175-200 positive cases to be excluded from Delaware's cumulative confirmed case count. These cases will be added in the coming days. As a result new cases reported may not have been diagnosed in the past 24 hour period.\n\nOn August 27, 2020, Delaware revised down total cases and confirmed positives.

We were able to update **Now hospitalized** from Florida's separate [hospitalization source](https://bi.ahca.myflorida.com/t/ABICC/views/Public/COVIDHospitalizationsCounty?:isGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&:embed=y). \n\nOn December 10, 2020,  we cleared **Deaths (confirmed)** from August 12 onward and are reporting them as **Deaths (confirmed and probable)**. On August 11, Florida added antigen tests to its data definition for deaths, which were previously PCR only.\n\nOn November 26, 2020, Florida did not update their data, presumably due to the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nOn November 3, 2020, Florida’s **Positive PCR Tests (specimens)** dropped by over 200 with no explanation.\n\nOn October 30, 2020, the number of negative residents ('T_NegRes') remained unchanged on Florida's ArcGIS layer. The number of unique people tested in 'totalTestsPeopleViral' draws from 'T_NegRes' and 'C_AllResTypes' fields on Florida's ArcGIS layer. \n\nOn October 26, 2020, Florida started providing a full timeseries of total test encounters excluding tests from individuals after they test positive. We started capturing this data in our `totalTestEncountersViral` field. As of October 27, 2020, Florida's total test results are also drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via the number of unique individuals testing positive and negative. The number of unique people tested, now drawn from the `T_NegRes` and `C_AllResTypes` values on Florida's ArcGIS layer, is still available in `totalTestsPeopleViral`. The new encounters time-series only reflects Florida residents, so we have also revised our existing cases figures and unique individuals tested figure to reflect only residents. These changes resulted in a 1.28% decrease in Florida's cases and a 0.38% decrease in Florida's unique people tested.\n\nOn October 21, 2020, only some of Florida's data updated by our publication time. Data points such as **Total PCR Tests (People)** did not update.\n\nAs of October 13, 2020, Florida's Antigen positive timeseries is stored in our **Probable cases** field, reflecting a response to our outreach to Florida's health department that it switches Antigen positive cases to PCR positive cases in their daily state report upon confirmatory PCR testing.\n\nOn October 10, 2020, Florida did not report COVID-19 data. The state initially reported that this was because Helix Laboratory, a private lab, submitted 400,000 previously submitted results, which required extra deduplication time. On October 12, 2020, [the Florida Department of Health announced](http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/10/101220-1127-covid19.pr.html) that the error was not the fault of the private lab, but was due to \"an unforeseen technical issue\" that was \"not the fault of Helix or the Department of Health.\" The state's data for October 11, 2020 appears to include data from both October 10 and 11.\n\nOn September 1, 2020, the Florida Department of Health [announced](http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/09/090120-1112-covid19.pr.html) that Quest Diagnostics had reported nearly 75,000 backlogged tests dating as far back as April.\n\nOn August 14, 2020, Florida began distinguishing between people with positive antigen tests and people with positive PCR tests in the Total Cases number given in their daily state report. As of September 30, 2020, we have removed these antigen positives from the values for **Cases or Confirmed cases** (`positiveCasesViral` in our API), so the values for this metric in our time series will be lower. **Cases (confirmed plus probable)** (`positive` in our API) will be unaffected.\n\nOn August 12, 2020, the Florida Department of Health reported via Twitter that it had received a large backlog of testing data from Niznik Lab Corp in Miami: \"The lab reported over 4,000 cases occurring over the last 7 weeks, but which had not been reported to FDOH until today. Therefore, this backlog severely skews today's daily report for Miami-Dade and is not reflective of current trends.\"\n\nAs of July 10, 2020, Florida reports **Now hospitalized** data for those patients with a \"primary diagnosis of COVID-19.\"\n\nSince May 15, 2020, Florida reports total tests in unique people and in unique people tested per lab. For that latter number, if an individual is tested twice by one lab, they only get counted once, but if an individual gets tested twice at different labs, they get counted twice. We store the former value in **Total PCR Tests (People)**, and the latter value, which does not match any of our totals units, in **Total Tests (PCR)**, our specimens field, where we also store testing data with unclear units. This value does **not** represent the number of specimens.\n\nOn March 21, 2020, Florida began including tests of people not investigated as PUIs in its **Negative PCR tests** metric.

This is due to the fact that the state has a strict 10AM cutoff for daily data reporting. This means the daily increase in cases encompasses more than one day's worth of data.\n\nOn October 15, 2020, Michigan announced that due to a laboratory result processing slowdown, several cases that would normally have been included in the October 14, 2020 update were reported on October 15, 2020.

As of December 3, 2020, North Dakota’s **Currently hospitalized** will include only patients hospitalized due to COVID.\n\nOn December 1, 2020, we made changes to our historical deaths counts, changing our **Deaths (confirmed)** source from “Deaths Due to COVID-19” to “Total number of individuals who tested positive and died from any cause while infected with COVID-19.” We had originally switched to use “Deaths Due to COVID-19” on July 1, 2020, but because of growing backlogs of individuals with COVID-19 tests whose death certificates have not yet been filed were not being picked up in the figure, we switched back to best reflect the reality in the state. The change caused a 241 cumulative rise in North Dakota’s death figures.\n\nOn October 8, 2020, North Dakota released two figures describing those who are currently hospitalized. According to the state dashboard annotation, the \"Hospitalized with COVID\" figure describes those whose main reason for hospitalization is COVID-19, and it also includes all those who are \"Hospitalized due to COVID\". We are using the \"Hospitalized with COVID\" figure for our **Currently hospitalized** and **Currently in ICU** metrics, however there are not matching Cumulative metrics so we are using the \"Due to COVID\" Cumulative hospitalized and ICU figures.\n\nOn November 12, 2020, North Dakota explained that higher than normal fluctuations may be seen in data from the week of November 9, 2020, due to a software issue which has been resolved.\n\nOn November 12, 2020, North Dakota announced on their COVID-19 dashboard that the high number of tests and positives was due in part to 5600 test backlog experienced by a third-party lab.\n\nOn November 11, 2020, North Dakota reported two days of data for all metrics except for Total PCR tests (specimens), Confirmed cases, and Positive cases (confirmed + probable).\n\nOn November 10, 2020, North Dakota reported that their software for hospitalization metrics was down, an issue which also impacts active cases. We updated Total PCR tests (specimens), Confirmed cases, and Positive cases (confirmed + probable) from their [daily news release](https://www.health.nd.gov/news/covid-19-test-results-0).\n\nAs of September 11, 2020, North Dakota’s total test results reflect total test encounters. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as `totalTestsPeopleViral`.\n\nOn September 9, 2020, North Dakota began reporting “Susceptible Encounters” on its dashboard, which are defined as test encounters excluding those who have tested positive after the first time. We have begun recording the value in our **Total PCR tests (test encounters)** field.\n\nOn August 19, 2020, North Dakota launched a new dashboard with a number of new data points, including race and ethnicity data and ICU data.

Because Oregon’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries due to late updates, we were unable to update their data on February 1, 2021.\n\nAs of December 9, 2020, Oregon’s total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. This change will cause Oregon’s `totalTestResults` to begin on March 29, 2020 instead of March 4, 2020. Because Oregon’s totalTestsViral represent only electronic laboratory reporting, whereas its cases and negatives represented tests from all sources, this change causes a decrease of 10,296 tests in `totalTestResults` on March 29. The old numbers remain available by summing the positive and negative fields of our API.\nIn addition, Oregon has not reported their total tests in people units since December 2, 2020 and they indicated that they will not continue to report total tests in people, so we have removed any values in **Total PCR tests (people)** we previously carried over.\n\nOn December 3, 2020, Oregon removed its total people tested metric, after adding total specimens on December 1. Because they did not provide a full timeseries of specimens, as of December 4, we switched our totalTestResults from people to specimens on December 2, 2020, and stopped calculating **Negative (people or cases)**. This causes an artificial increase of totalTestResults by 960,248 on that day. \n\nOn December 1, 2020, **Negative (people or cases)** decreased by 3,258 from 968,686 to 965,428. Oregon did not post an explanation.

We also backfilled **Positive antibody tests (specimens)** from the data provided by Texas at the same time.\n\nOn November 11, 2020, Texas reported that their update to **Deaths (confirmed and probable)** would be delayed due to technical difficulties.\n\nAs of August 16, 2020, several commercial laboratories submitted previously backlogged test results to the Texas Department of State Health Services. As a result, new confirmed cases may not have occurred in the past 24 hours. The Texas Department of State Health Services is working to resolve these issues.\n\nOn August 2, 2020, Texas noted that \"New data will not be posted on this dashboard on Sunday, August 2 due to a scheduled upgrade to the system that processes electronic lab reports. Data for Sunday will be posted with Monday’s data update.\"\n\nOn July 30, 2020, Texas noted that \"Cumulative fatalities have been corrected for July 27–29. As DSHS shifted to using death certificate data to count fatalities this week, an automation error caused approximately 225 fatalities to be included that did not have COVID-19 listed as a direct cause of death.\"\n\nOn July 27, 2020, Texas added 675 additional deaths through death certificate reviews. However only 44 deaths were truly \"new\" deaths on July 27. This will create a one-day artificial apparent daily increase in deaths.\n\nOn July 25, 2020, Texas reported that 2092 probable cases had been removed from the statewide case totals by the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District. That removal meant that the number of total cases for Texas appeared smaller than it was. The actual number of new cases in Texas that day was 8,112, not 6,020. \n\nStarting July 23, 2020, Texas has reported that its current hospitalization and ICU numbers are incomplete due to its transition to the HHS reporting system. We carried over hospitalization figures until July 28. We will backfill the complete numbers for July 23–July 28 if the complete data becomes available.\n\nOn July 22, 2020, we began reporting **Currently in ICU** for Texas. We are currently reviewing historical data to maintain an accurate time-series. \n\nOn June 16, 2020, Texas notes that \"The reported cases for June 16 include 2,622 new cases and 1,476 cases that were previously diagnosed among Texas Department of Criminal Justice inmates but that had not been reported by local health departments (887 from Anderson County and 589 from Brazoria County).\" \n\nAs of May 23, 2020, Texas reports PCR tests separately from antibody tests.","covid19Site":"https://txdshs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/ed483ecd702b4298ab01e8b9cafc8b83","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://services5.arcgis.com/ACaLB9ifngzawspq/ArcGIS/rest/services/TX_DSHS_COVID19_Test[…]&outFields=%2A&orderByFields=Date+desc&resultRecordCount=1","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://www.dshs.texas.gov/coronavirus/TexasCOVID-19HospitalizationsOverTimebyTSA.xlsx","covid19SiteQuaternary":"https://txdshs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/0d8bdf9be927459d9cb11b9eaef6101f","covid19SiteQuinary":null,"twitter":"@TexasDSHS","covid19SiteOld":"https://dshs.texas.gov/coronavirus/","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Specimens","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"totalTestsViral","totalTestResultsField":"Total Tests (PCR)","pui":"Only positives","pum":false,"name":"Texas","fips":"48"},{"state":"UT","notes":"On December 25, 2020, Utah did not update their data by the time of our daily update, presumably due to the Christmas holiday.\n\nOn November 25, 2020, Utah [announced](https://twitter.com/UtahCoronavirus/status/1331703634942451715) via their official Utah COVID-19 response twitter that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020.

We have also applied this change retroactively going back to May 13, 2020 for Currently hospitalized, and September 19, 2020 for Currently in ICU.\n\nOn November 26, 2020, Washington announced on their [COVID-19 Data Dashboard](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/DataDashboard) that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020. Because Washington’s data is on a one day lag in our time series due to late update times, we will be unable to update Washington’s data on November 27, 2020.\n\nOn November 24, 2020, Washington announced that the Department of Health will not be reporting new negative test results and temporarily removed the **Total tests (in test encounters)** metric from the dashboard. As a result all testing numbers were frozen until the state resumed updating them on December 4, 2020.  Because Washington’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, this update will be shown on our data for December 5, 2020.\n\nAs of September 18, 2020, Washington's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.\n\nOn August 26, 2020, Washington switched its total tests units to testing encounters, excluding future encounters from individuals who test positive. It also provided a full timeseries of the figure. This testing encounters figure is slightly different from how we define testing encounters in two ways: first, our definition of testing encounters includes encounters after a positive test, and second, it should be calculated not by summing resulted tests but by counting all daily tests in a separate reporting stream. Despite these differences, the historical and current values of Washington’s figure are still stored in our **Total PCR tests (test encounters)** field.\n\nOn August 2, 2020, Washington state Department of Health reported that \"DOH is continuing to experience issues with its reporting system today. We are able to report cases, deaths and hospitalizations but have not reported new negative test results since 8/1.\"\n\nOn July 14, 2020, Washington state revised its count of COVID-19 **deaths** downward by 39, because it determined that even though those 39 people had tested positive for COVID-19, COVID-19 was not a contributing cause in their deaths.\n\nOn June 22, 2020, we updated previous values for **cases** and **total tests** in our time-series using data from Washington state's dashboard. This update caused an artificial decrease in cases and tests between June 21 and June 22.\n\nOn June 18, 2020, Washington revised its **Total PCR tests (people)** downward. On the same date, Washington decreased its count of COVID-19 **deaths by 7**, because it determined that even though those 7 people had tested positive for COVID-19, COVID-19 was not a contributing cause in their deaths.\n\nOn April 18, 2020, Washington state removed 190 **confirmed cases** that were discovered to be out-of-state residents tested in Washington laboratories. \n\nBetween March 31 and April 15, 2020, Washington state did not report **Negative PCR tests (people)**.

We subsequently updated our historical Cases data using data provided to us by the state, which eliminated this one-day increase. \n\nOn March 30, 2020, Wisconsin revised its cumulative **Negative PCR tests (people)** data downward without explanation.\"","covid19Site":"https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/data.htm","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/hosp-data.htm","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://bi.wisconsin.gov/t/DHS/views/PercentofconfirmedprobableCOVID-19casesby-group-MOBILE/CaseDB2/butleoljdl@accounts.wistate.us/ed25311e-7f8a-4c7d-aee8-97b28850f0ac?:embed=y&:display_spinner=no&:showAppBanner=false&:embed_code_version=3&:loadOrderID=4&:display_count=n&:showVizHome=n&:origin=viz_share_link","covid19SiteQuaternary":"https://bi.wisconsin.gov/t/DHS/views/PercentofCOVID-19deathsby-group-MOBILE/DeathDB2?:embed_code_version=3&:embed=y&:loadOrderID=2&:display_spinner=no&:showAppBanner=false&:display_count=n&:showVizHome=n&:origin=viz_share_link","covid19SiteQuinary":"https://bi.wisconsin.gov/t/DHS/views/PercentofCOVID-19deathsby-group-MOBILE/DeathDB2?:embed_code_version=3&:embed=y&:loadOrderID=2&:display_spinner=no&:showAppBanner=false&:display_count=n&:showVizHome=n&:origin=viz_share_link","twitter":"@DHSWI","covid19SiteOld":"https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/disease/covid-19.htm","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Encounters","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"totalTestEncountersViral","totalTestResultsField":"Total Test Encounters (PCR)","pui":"All data","pum":false,"name":"Wisconsin","fips":"55"},{"state":"WV","notes":"West Virginia reports new antibody tests daily.

As a result, please exercise extra caution when using numbers that are calculated from daily changes, especially if these calculations use multiple metrics. If anomalies are observed, numbers from previous days will be carried over until corrections are made.\n\nWyoming reports the number of people *Ever hospitalized* with COVID-19 as a percentage of “Lab Confirmed Cases by Reported Hospitalization” on their [Statistics page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-map-and-statistics/). In the absence of a better data source we convert this percentage to an integer, and as a result of the calculation, this value may fluctuate.\n\nNegatives reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.\n\nOn February 02, 2021, Wyoming’s Total PCR tests (specimens) decreased by roughly 4,600 and their Total PCR tests (people) decreased by approximately 1,500 without explanation. As a result, Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated as Total PCR tests (people) minus Confirmed cases, decreased by roughly 1,600.\n\nOn January 25, 2021, Wyoming’s **Total PCR tests (specimens)** decreased by roughly 106k, and their **Total PCR tests (people)** decreased by about 3.6k without explanation. Their **Positive PCR tests (specimens)** and **Negative PCR tests (specimens)** did not reflect that decrease, so we did not update their **Total PCR tests (specimens)**, **Total PCR tests (people)**, or **Negative PCR tests (people)**, which is calculated as **Total PCR tests (people)** minus **Confirmed cases** on January 25, 2021 to ensure our data is as accurate as possible.\n\nOn January 12, 2021, Wyoming reported more new Confirmed cases than new Total PCR tests (people). As a result, Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated as Total PCR tests (people) minus Confirmed Cases decreased by 85.\n\nOn December 24, 2020, Wyoming announced on their [COVID-19 page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/) that there would be no update to their data on December 24, 2020 or December 25, 2020. On January 1, 2021, they noted that there would be no update to their data on January 1, 2021.We were able to update **Now hospitalized** from Wyoming's separate [hospitalization source](https://sites.google.com/wyo.gov/exec-covid19/hospital-resources) on both days.\n\nOn December 2, 2020, Wyoming's cumulative **Positive PCR Tests (specimens)** decreased by about 2,000, **Negative PCR Tests (specimens)** decreased by about 13,000, and **Total PCR Tests (specimens)** decreased by about 11,000. The data for these metrics, obtained by downloading the Crosstab data on [Wyoming's State and County Dashboards](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-state-and-county-dashboards/), has been unreliable over the last week. Please use caution when using this data.  \n\nAs of November 25, 2020, Wyoming's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. \n\nOn November 27, 2020, Wyoming’s **Positive PCR tests (specimens)** decreased by about 10,000 without explanation. We believed that this decrease may be an error, and did not update Wyoming’s **Positive PCR tests (specimens)** and **Negative PCR tests (specimens)**, which come from the same source on November 27, 2020. On November 28, 2020, and November 29, 2020, we were unable to update Positive PCR tests (specimens) and Negative PCR tests (specimens) because Wyoming only updates these metrics on Monday through Friday.\n\nOn November 26, 2020, Wyoming announced on their [COVID-19 page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/) that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020.\n\nOn November 25, 2020, we started collecting *Total PCR tests (specimens)* from the \"Wyoming Updates\" section of Wyoming's [COVID-19 page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/) and started collecting **Positive tests PCR (specimens)** and **Negative tests PCR (specimens)** from the values in the graph on the \"Laboratory Results by Date\" graph on their [COVID-19 State and County Dashboards page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-state-and-county-dashboards/). At the same time, we backfilled all three of the above time series based on the numbers from the second page, summing the positive and negative numbers to use for the historical totals.\n\nOn November 17, 2020, Wyoming’s **Confirmed cases** increased by more than their **Total PCR tests (specimens)** without explanation. As a result, **Negative PCR tests (people)**, which are calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** decreased.\n\nOn October 14, 2020, Wyoming's **Total PCR Tests (specimens)** and **Total PCR Tests (people)** values both decreased by over 1000 with no explanation. We believe the state might have deduplicated its data.\n\nOn June 19, 2020, Wyoming began reporting **Total PCR tests (people)** as well as **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.\n\nOn April 28, 2020, we began to report **probable cases** together with **confirmed cases**.\n\nDuring the week of April 7, 2020, Wyoming began to report both confirmed and probable cases in its **Recovered** metrics.\n\nDuring the week of April 6, 2020, Wyoming began reporting confirmed and probable cases separately.\n","covid19Site":"https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-map-and-statistics/","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-testing-data/","covid19SiteQuaternary":"https://sites.google.com/wyo.gov/exec-covid19/hospital-resources","covid19SiteQuinary":"https://public.tableau.com/views/StateandCountyDashboard/Dashboard1?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no&:host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F&:embed_code_version=3&:tabs=no&:toolbar=yes&:animate_transition=yes&:display_static_image=no&:display_spinner=no&:display_overlay=yes&:display_count=yes&:language=en&publish=yes&:loadOrderID=0","twitter":"@health_wyoming","covid19SiteOld":"https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Specimens","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"totalTestsViral","totalTestResultsField":"Total Tests (PCR)","pui":"No data","pum":false,"name":"Wyoming","fips":"56"}]
