{"state":"WI","notes":"On October 29, we populated the full time series for Total Test Encounters (PCR) from a time series provided by Wisconsin via CSV on their dashboard. Also as of October 29, Wisconsin's `totalTestResults` represent total test encounters instead of being calculated via pos+neg. The number of unique people ever tested remains available in the API in the `totalTestsPeopleViral` field.\n\nOn October 20, Wisconsin started providing a total tests number on their dashboard and we started to collect that data into Total Test Encounters (PCR).\n\nIn early June of 2020, Wisconsin started reporting probable deaths from COVID-19 separately from confirmed deaths from COVID-19. We did not discover this data until June 29, 2020, and so our time series only has data for this metric beginning on that date.\n\nIn early June of 2020, Wisconsin started reporting probable cases of COVID-19 separately from confirmed cases of COVID-19. On June 25, 2020, The COVID Tracking Project added more than two weeks' worth of probable cases to our **Cases (confirmed plus probable)** for WI, initially causing a large single day increase in cases. We subsequently updated our historical Cases data using data provided to us by the state, which eliminated this one-day increase.\n\nOn March 30, 2020, Wisconsin revised its cumulative **Negative PCR tests (people)** data downward without explanation.","covid19Site":"https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/data.htm","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/hosp-data.htm","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://bi.wisconsin.gov/t/DHS/views/PercentofconfirmedprobableCOVID-19casesby-group-MOBILE/CaseDB2/butleoljdl@accounts.wistate.us/ed25311e-7f8a-4c7d-aee8-97b28850f0ac?:embed=y&:display_spinner=no&:showAppBanner=false&:embed_code_version=3&:loadOrderID=4&:display_count=n&:showVizHome=n&:origin=viz_share_link","covid19SiteQuaternary":"https://bi.wisconsin.gov/t/DHS/views/PercentofCOVID-19deathsby-group-MOBILE/DeathDB2?:embed_code_version=3&:embed=y&:loadOrderID=2&:display_spinner=no&:showAppBanner=false&:display_count=n&:showVizHome=n&:origin=viz_share_link","covid19SiteQuinary":"https://bi.wisconsin.gov/t/DHS/views/PercentofCOVID-19deathsby-group-MOBILE/DeathDB2?:embed_code_version=3&:embed=y&:loadOrderID=2&:display_spinner=no&:showAppBanner=false&:display_count=n&:showVizHome=n&:origin=viz_share_link","twitter":"@DHSWI","covid19SiteOld":"https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/disease/covid-19.htm","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Encounters","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"totalTestEncountersViral","totalTestResultsField":"Total Test Encounters (PCR)","pui":"All data","pum":false,"name":"Wisconsin","fips":"55"}
