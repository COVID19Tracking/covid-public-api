{"state":"WI","notes":"On March 30, 2020, Wisconsin revised its cumulative **Negative PCR tests (people)** data downward without explanation.\n\nIn early June of 2020, Wisconsin started reporting probable cases of COVID-19 separately from confirmed cases of COVID-19. On June 25, 2020, The COVID Tracking Project added more than two weeks' worth of probable cases to our **Cases (confirmed plus probable)** for WI, initially causing a large single day increase in cases. We subsequently updated our historical Cases data using data provided to us by the state, which eliminated this one-day increase.\n\nIn early June of 2020, Wisconsin started reporting probable deaths from COVID-19 separately from confirmed deaths from COVID-19. We did not discover this data until June 29, 2020, and so our time series only has data for this metric beginning on that date.\n","covid19Site":"https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/outbreaks/index.htm","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/data.htm","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/hosp-data.htm","twitter":"@DHSWI","covid19SiteOld":"https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/disease/covid-19.htm","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"People","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"posNeg","name":"Wisconsin","fips":"55","pui":"","pum":false}
