{"state":"WI","notes":"Negatives include only Wisconsin residents whose negative test results were reported electronically to DHS. This underestimates total negative test results. \nDeaths must be reported by health providers or coroners, and recorded by local health departments, to be counted. As of April 27, Wisconsin is reporting people tested. \nOn March 30, WI revised down negatives from 16550 to 15856.\nOn June 25th, Wisconsin reported probable cases for the first time, including a large number of cases from earlier in the pandemic. Initially this manifested as a large single day jump in cases, but in the late evening we updated our historical case numbers to include these on the appropriate days based on historical data provided to us by the state.","covid19Site":"https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/outbreaks/index.htm","covid19SiteSecondary":"","covid19SiteTertiary":"","twitter":"@DHSWI","covid19SiteOld":"https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/disease/covid-19.htm","name":"Wisconsin","fips":"55","pui":"","pum":false}
