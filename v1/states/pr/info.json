{"state":"PR","notes":"Reported **Deaths** include both confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths.\n\nPuerto Rico does not report test data on its data dashboard. Data for **Total PCR Tests (in specimens)** and **Positive PCR Tests (in specimens)** is taken from infrequent press reports.\n\nOn November 7, 2020, Puerto Rico switched from using antibody tests to antigen tests to identify probable cases in accordance with August 2020 CSTE guidelines. This caused probable cases to drop by 33,888. We cleared probable case history to match the new definition.\n\nOn November 2, 2020, Puerto Rico removed 551 recoveries without explanation.\n\nOn July 7, 2020, we updated **Negative PCR tests** based on press releases from May and June.\n\nOn May 6, 2020, Puerto Rico stopped reporting **Negative PCR tests**.\n\nOn April 22, 2020, Puerto Rico's data changed due to deduplication. This resulted in a decrease in **Total cases**.","covid19Site":"https://estadisticas.pr/en/covid-19","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://bioseguridad.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/3bfb64c9a91944bc8c41edd8ff27e6df","covid19SiteTertiary":"http://www.salud.gov.pr/Pages/coronavirus.aspx","covid19SiteQuaternary":"https://bioseguridad.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/3bfb64c9a91944bc8c41edd8ff27e6df","covid19SiteQuinary":"https://bioseguridad.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/3bfb64c9a91944bc8c41edd8ff27e6df","twitter":"@DeptSaludPR","covid19SiteOld":"http://www.salud.gov.pr/Pages/coronavirus.aspx","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Specimens","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"posNeg","totalTestResultsField":"posNeg","pui":"No Data","pum":false,"name":"Puerto Rico","fips":"72"}
