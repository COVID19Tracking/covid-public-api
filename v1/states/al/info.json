{"state":"AL","notes":"Alabama combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard.\n\nNegative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.\n\nOn November 25, 2020, Alabama announced that the Alabama Department of Public Health Infection Disease and Outbreak team reviewed their electronic disease surveillance system and “updated some parameters”. As a result, Recovered increased by roughly 71k on November 25, 2020.\n\nOn November 14, 2020, Alabama announced that a backlog of 109 positive antigen results would be reported as probable cases on November 14, 2020. As a result, new probable cases reported on November 14, 2020 were not all reported in the previous 24 hour period.\n\nOn November 11, 2020, Alabama announced via their [dashboard](https://alpublichealth.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/6d2771faa9da4a2786a509d82c8cf0f7) that they have begun a review process for deaths from the Alabama Center for Health Statistics (ACHS). According to Alabama, at least half of the **Deaths (confirmed and probable)** reported today (81 in total) are from this review. More deaths may be added from this review in the coming days.\n\nOn November 10, 2020 Alabama’s Total PCR tests (specimens) decreased by roughly 700 without explanation.\n\nOn October 21, 2020, Alabama did not update their COVID-19 dashboard due to \"technical issues\".\n\nAs of September 18, 2020, Alabama's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.\n\nOn September 1, 2020, Alabama began displaying the number of people tested by antibody, over 50,000 individuals, separately from its main total tested field, which it clarified represents antigen and PCR testing. Its main total tested number dropped by over 25,000 the same day. We have reached out to the Alabama Department of Public Health to confirm this drop was due to the removal of the individuals tested by antibody.\n\nOn July 15, 2020, we changed our data reporting to reflect that Alabama reports test totals in specimens rather than unique people tested, as we had initially believed. All test results were moved into the correct API field and metric.\n\nOn July 11, 2020, Alabama began using direct reports from hospitals for cumulative hospitalizations (which we report in our **Ever hospitalized** metric), rather than state case surveillance. Its number of cumulative hospitalizations increased by over 3,000 as a result.
