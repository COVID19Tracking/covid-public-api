AL,"Alabama combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.

On October 21, 2020, Alabama did not update their COVID-19 dashboard due to ""technical issues"".

As of September 18, 2020, Alabama's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

On September 1, 2020, Alabama began displaying the number of people tested by antibody, over 50,000 individuals, separately from its main total tested field, which it clarified represents antigen and PCR testing. Its main total tested number dropped by over 25,000 the same day. We have reached out to the Alabama Department of Public Health to confirm this drop was due to the removal of the individuals tested by antibody.

On July 15, 2020, we changed our data reporting to reflect that Alabama reports test totals in specimens rather than unique people tested, as we had initially believed. All test results were moved into the correct API field and metric.

On July 11, 2020, Alabama began using direct reports from hospitals for cumulative hospitalizations (which we report in our **Ever hospitalized** metric), rather than state case surveillance. Its number of cumulative hospitalizations increased by over 3,000 as a result.
