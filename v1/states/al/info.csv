AL,"Negatives = (Totals - Positives) 
Positives occasionally update before totals do; do not revise negatives down, keep the last calculated negative.

On July 11, Alabama changed its cumulative hospitalization data source to come directly from hospitals rather than from state case surveillance files. As a result of this new data source, its hospitalizations increased by 3,616 from 3,129 to 6,745.

On July 15 we corrected our reporting of Alabama tests: Alabama reports tests in units of specimens (tests) rather than individuals (people tested). We will correct our historical time series by backfiilling the data as soon as possible.
