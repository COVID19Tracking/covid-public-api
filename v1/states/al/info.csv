AL,"Alabama combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard.

On July 11, 2020, Alabama began using direct reports from hospitals for cumulative hospitalizations (which we report in our **Ever hospitalized** metric), rather than state case surveillance. Its number of cumulative hospitalizations increased by 3,616 from 3,129 to 6,745 as a result. 

On July 15, 2020, we changed our data reporting to reflect that Alabama reports test totals in specimens rather than unique people tested, as we had initially believed. All test results were moved into the correct API field and metric.

On September 1, 2020, Alabama began displaying the number of people tested by antibody, 54,076 individuals, separately from its main total tested field, which it clarified represents antigen and PCR testing. Its main total tested number dropped by 26,943 the same day. We have reached out to the Alabama Department of Public Health to confirm this drop was due to the removal of the individuals tested by antibody.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.",https://alpublichealth.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/6d2771faa9da4a2786a509d82c8cf0f7,https://alpublichealth.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/6d2771faa9da4a2786a509d82c8cf0f7,https://services7.arcgis.com/4RQmZZ0yaZkGR1zy/arcgis/rest/services/HospitalizedPatientTemporal_READ_ONLY/FeatureServer/1/query?where=1%3D1&orderbyfields=DateTxt+desc&outFields=%2A&resultRecordCount=1,@alpublichealth,http://www.alabamapublichealth.gov/infectiousdiseases/2019-coronavirus.html,Unclear units,totalTestsViral,Alabama,01,,false
