WV,"West Virginia reports new antibody tests daily. We sum these numbers in a running total to report a value for the total number of antibody tests West Virginia has conducted. 

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.

On July 4, 2020, West Virginia began making continual changes to its previous data for antibody testing, so its historical time series might not match COVID Tracking Project data.

On May 23, 2020, West Virginia began reporting PCR and antibody tests separately. Total test values before this date might include both PCR and antibody tests.

On April 16, 2020, West Virginia began reporting **current hospitalization, ICU, and ventilator** metrics from 49 of 55 counties. Before April 16, 2020, those counts were less complete, as they were based on completed investigations rather than on hospital data.",https://dhhr.wv.gov/Coronavirus%20Disease-COVID-19/Pages/default.aspx,https://dhhr.wv.gov/Coronavirus%20Disease-COVID-19/Pages/default.aspx,https://dhhr.wv.gov/Coronavirus%20Disease-COVID-19/Pages/default.aspx,https://dhhr.wv.gov/Coronavirus%20Disease-COVID-19/Pages/default.aspx,,@WV_DHHR,https://dhhr.wv.gov/Coronavirus%20Disease-COVID-19/Pages/default.aspx,Specimens,posNeg,posNeg,All data,false,West Virginia,54
