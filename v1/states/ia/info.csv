IA,"As of May 19, 2020, Iowa reports PCR and antibody tests separately.

On September 26, 2020, Iowa announced that due to a data update, roughly 27,000 antigen tests from long-term care facilities will be added to their COVID-19 antigen test data. This update will occur from September 26, 2020 to September 27, 2020, and will result in an increased number of antigen test tests reported in our data for Iowa. (Antigen data is available in our CSVs and API.)

On October 16, 2020, Iowa removed 12,831 tests from the state’s PCR test total. On the same day, 19,308 tests were added to the state’s antigen test total. We were unable to locate an official explanation, but surmise that these changes were the result of data cleaning and reorganization work.",https://coronavirus.iowa.gov/,https://coronavirus.iowa.gov/pages/access,https://coronavirus.iowa.gov/pages/case-counts,https://coronavirus.iowa.gov/pages/rmcc-data,https://coronavirus.iowa.gov/pages/serology-testing,@IAPublicHealth,https://idph.iowa.gov/Emerging-Health-Issues/Novel-Coronavirus,People,posNeg,posNeg,All data,false,Iowa,19
