GA,"As of May 27, 2020, Georgia reports antibody tests separately from PCR tests. This change reduced the number for total tests by approximately 74,000.

As of August 28, 2020, we started reporting patients Now hospitalized from the [Georgia Geospatial Information Office](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/e40c39564f724af7bfe8fd5d88deadb6). The new count includes both patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and patients under investigation, as is our standard practice where possible.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.
