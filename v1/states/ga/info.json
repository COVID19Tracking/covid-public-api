{"state":"GA","notes":"Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data. \n\nOn November 3, 2020, Georgia started reporting probable deaths and antigen positive cases in their COVID-19 Daily Status report. On November 4, we added the probable deaths in our **Deaths (probable)** field for November 3 and 4, causing the daily rise in deaths on the 3rd to appear as 480. This large increase includes the data dump of 450 probable deaths, many of which are not from the most recent 24 hour period. We also began recording the 29,937 antigen positive cases in our `positiveTestsPeopleAntigen` field. We have reached out to Georgia's health department for clarity on the definition of this number. \n\nOn October 21, 2020, Georgia did not update their \"COVID-19 Daily Status Report\" by the time of our daily update due to technical issues. In order to provide the most up to date data possible, we updated only **Current Hospitalizations**, which are sourced from a different Georgia government website.\n\nAs of September 18, 2020, Georgia's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.\n\nAs of August 28, 2020, we started reporting patients Now hospitalized from the [Georgia Geospatial Information Office](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/e40c39564f724af7bfe8fd5d88deadb6). The new count includes both patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and patients under investigation, as is our standard practice where possible.\n\nAs of May 27, 2020, Georgia reports antibody tests separately from PCR tests. This change reduced the number for total tests by approximately 74,000.","covid19Site":"https://dph.georgia.gov/covid-19-daily-status-report","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/e40c39564f724af7bfe8fd5d88deadb6","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://augustagis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/4eec20925b6b4f338368df0ffcba472d","covid19SiteQuaternary":null,"covid19SiteQuinary":null,"twitter":"@GaDPH","covid19SiteOld":"https://dph.georgia.gov/novelcoronavirus","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Specimens","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"totalTestsViral","totalTestResultsField":"Total Tests (PCR)","pui":"Only positives","pum":false,"name":"Georgia","fips":"13"}
