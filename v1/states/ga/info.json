{"state":"GA","notes":"Positive includes deaths. Positives occasionally update before totals.\nWe use the state's \"as of\" time as our Update Time. \n\nAs of May 16, Georgia is reporting specimens tested. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested. \n\nAs of May 27, Georgia started separating serology tests from PCR. Total test numbers were impacted by around 74,000.\nGeorgia makes changes to its cumulative case counts for previous dates, so its historical time series and trends for case counts might not match ours. When we can, we will update our own historical time series to match theirs.","covid19Site":"https://dph.georgia.gov/covid-19-daily-status-report","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://augustagis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/4eec20925b6b4f338368df0ffcba472d","covid19SiteTertiary":"","twitter":"@GaDPH","covid19SiteOld":"https://dph.georgia.gov/novelcoronavirus","name":"Georgia","fips":"13","pui":"","pum":false}
