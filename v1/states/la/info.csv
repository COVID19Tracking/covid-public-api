LA,"Louisiana reports probable deaths on a weekly basis.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting *Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (people)** in the absence of better data.

On August 30 Louisiana's reported data included 532 older cases that had not previously been reported; these cases had specimen collection dates ranging back to July 1.

On August 26, 2020, Louisiana started reporting Probable cases, this caused a notable increase in **Total cases**.

On June 19, 2020, Louisiana's data changed due to deduplication and the state's removal of out-of-state cases.

Between April 20 and April 24, 2020, Louisiana did not report testing data from commercial labs due to a state review of data.",http://ldh.la.gov/Coronavirus/,https://services5.arcgis.com/O5K6bb5dZVZcTo5M/arcgis/rest/services/Combined_COVID_Reporting/FeatureServer/0/query?groupByFieldsForStatistics=Measure&outStatistics=%5B%7B%27statisticType%27%3A+%27sum%27%2C+%27onStatisticField%27%3A+%27Value%27%7D%5D&where=1%3D1,,,,@LADeptHealth,http://ldh.la.gov/Coronavirus/,People,posNeg,posNeg,Only positives,false,Louisiana,22
