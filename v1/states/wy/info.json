{"state":"WY","notes":"Wyoming's metrics do not update every day, and don't always update together. As a result, please exercise extra caution when using numbers that are calculated from daily changes, especially if these calculations use multiple metrics.\r\n\r\nWyoming reports the number of people *Ever hospitalized* with COVID-19 as a percentage of “Lab Confirmed Cases by Reported Hospitalization” on their [Statistics page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-map-and-statistics/). In the absence of a better data source we convert these percentages to integers, and as a result of the calculation, these values may fluctuate.\r\n\r\nNegatives reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.\r\n\r\nAs of November 25, 2020, Wyoming's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. \r\n\r\nOn November 25, 2020, we started collecting *Total PCR tests (specimens)* from the \"Wyoming Updates\" section of Wyoming's [COVID-19 page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/) and started collecting *Positive tests PCR (specimens)* and *Negative tests PCR (specimens)* from the values in the graph on the \"Laboratory Results by Date\" graph on their [COVID-19 State and County Dashboards page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-state-and-county-dashboards/). At the same time, we backfilled all three of the above time series based on the numbers from the second page, summing the positive and negative numbers to use for the historical totals.\r\n\r\nOn November 17, 2020, Wyoming’s Confirmed cases increased by more than their **Total PCR tests (specimens)** without explanation. As a result, **Negative PCR tests (people)**, which are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** decreased.\r\n\r\nOn October 14, 2020, Wyoming's **Total PCR Tests (specimens)** and **Total PCR Tests (people)** values both decreased by over 1000 with no explanation. We believe the state might have deduplicated its data.\r\n\r\nOn August 26, 2020, Wyoming did not report **Total PCR tests (people).** We have carried over the previous day's value.\r\n\r\nOn June 19, 2020, Wyoming began reporting **Total PCR tests (people)** as well as **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.\r\n\r\nOn April 28, 2020, we began to report **probable cases** together with **confirmed cases**.\r\n\r\nOn April 22, 2020, Wyoming revised its **Total PCR tests (specimens)** downward, resulting in a corresponding decrease in the calculated value of **Negative PCR tests (specimens)**. \r\n\r\nDuring the week of April 7, 2020, Wyoming began to report both confirmed and probable cases in its Recovered metrics.\r\n\r\nDuring the week of April 6, 2020, Wyoming began reporting confirmed and probable cases separately.\r\n","covid19Site":"https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-map-and-statistics/","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-testing-data/","covid19SiteQuaternary":"https://sites.google.com/wyo.gov/exec-covid19/hospital-resources","covid19SiteQuinary":null,"twitter":"@health_wyoming","covid19SiteOld":"https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Specimens","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"totalTestsViral","totalTestResultsField":"Total Tests (PCR)","pui":"No data","pum":false,"name":"Wyoming","fips":"56"}
