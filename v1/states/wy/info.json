{"state":"WY","notes":"Wyoming reports **Positive tests PCR (specimens)** and **Negative tests PCR (specimens)** as percentages of **Total tests PCR** in the graph \"COVID-19 Resulted Tests by Result\" on their [Testing page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-testing-data/). Wyoming also reports the number of people **Ever hospitalized** with COVID-19 as a percentage of “Lab Confirmed Cases by Reported Hospitalization” on their [Statistics page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-map-and-statistics/). In the absence of better data we convert these percentages to integers, and as a result of the calculation, these values may fluctuate. \n\nNegative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.\n\nOn November 17, 2020, Wyoming’s Confirmed cases increased by more than their **Total PCR tests (specimens)** without explanation. As a result, **Negative PCR tests (people)**, which are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** decreased.\n\nOn October 14, 2020, Wyoming's **Total PCR Tests (specimens)** and **Total PCR Tests (people)** values both decreased by over 1000 with no explanation. We believe the state might have deduplicated its data.\n\nOn August 26, 2020, Wyoming did not report **Total PCR tests (people).** We have carried over the previous day's value.\n\nOn June 19, 2020, Wyoming began reporting **Total PCR tests (people)** as well as **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.\n\nOn April 28, 2020, we began to report **probable cases** together with **confirmed cases**.\n\nOn April 22, 2020, Wyoming revised its **Total PCR tests (specimens)** downward, resulting in a corresponding decrease in the calculated value of **Negative PCR tests (specimens)**. \n\nDuring the week of April 7, 2020, Wyoming began to report both confirmed and probable cases in its Recovered metrics.\n\nDuring the week of April 6, 2020, Wyoming began reporting confirmed and probable cases separately.","covid19Site":"https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-map-and-statistics/","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-testing-data/","covid19SiteQuaternary":null,"covid19SiteQuinary":null,"twitter":"@health_wyoming","covid19SiteOld":"https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"People","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"posNeg","totalTestResultsField":"posNeg","pui":"No data","pum":false,"name":"Wyoming","fips":"56"}
