{"state":"WY","notes":"Wyoming’s metrics do not update every day, and don’t always update together. As a result, please exercise extra caution when using numbers that are calculated from daily changes, especially if these calculations use multiple metrics. If anomalies are observed, numbers from previous days will be carried over until corrections are made.\n\nWyoming reports the number of people *Ever hospitalized* with COVID-19 as a percentage of “Lab Confirmed Cases by Reported Hospitalization” on their [Statistics page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-map-and-statistics/). In the absence of a better data source we convert this percentage to an integer, and as a result of the calculation, this value may fluctuate.\n\nNegatives reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.\n\nOn December 2, 2020, Wyoming's cumulative **Positive PCR Tests (specimens)** decreased by about 2,000, Negative PCR Tests (specimens) decreased by about 13,000, and ***Total PCR Tests (specimens)** decreased by about 11,000. The data for these metrics, obtained by downloading the Crosstab data on [Wyoming's State and County Dashboards](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-state-and-county-dashboards/), has been unreliable over the last week. Please use caution when using this data.  \n\nAs of November 25, 2020, Wyoming's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. \n\nOn November 27, 2020, Wyoming’s Positive PCR tests (specimens) decreased by about 10,000 without explanation. We believed that this decrease may be an error, and did not update Wyoming’s Positive PCR tests (specimens) and Negative PCR tests (specimens), which come from the same source on November 27, 2020. On November 28, 2020, and November 29, 2020, we were unable to update Positive PCR tests (specimens) and Negative PCR tests (specimens) because Wyoming only updates these metrics on Monday through Friday.\n\nOn November 26, 2020, Wyoming announced on their [COVID-19 page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/) that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020.\n\nOn November 25, 2020, we started collecting *Total PCR tests (specimens)* from the \"Wyoming Updates\" section of Wyoming's [COVID-19 page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/) and started collecting *Positive tests PCR (specimens)* and *Negative tests PCR (specimens)* from the values in the graph on the \"Laboratory Results by Date\" graph on their [COVID-19 State and County Dashboards page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-state-and-county-dashboards/). At the same time, we backfilled all three of the above time series based on the numbers from the second page, summing the positive and negative numbers to use for the historical totals.\n\nOn November 17, 2020, Wyoming’s Confirmed cases increased by more than their **Total PCR tests (specimens)** without explanation. As a result, **Negative PCR tests (people)**, which are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** decreased.\n\nOn October 14, 2020, Wyoming's **Total PCR Tests (specimens)** and **Total PCR Tests (people)** values both decreased by over 1000 with no explanation. We believe the state might have deduplicated its data.\n\nOn August 26, 2020, Wyoming did not report **Total PCR tests (people).** We have carried over the previous day's value.\n\nOn June 19, 2020, Wyoming began reporting **Total PCR tests (people)** as well as **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.\n\nOn April 28, 2020, we began to report **probable cases** together with **confirmed cases**.\n\nDuring the week of April 7, 2020, Wyoming began to report both confirmed and probable cases in its Recovered metrics.\n\nDuring the week of April 6, 2020, Wyoming began reporting confirmed and probable cases separately.\n","covid19Site":"https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-map-and-statistics/","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-testing-data/","covid19SiteQuaternary":"https://sites.google.com/wyo.gov/exec-covid19/hospital-resources","covid19SiteQuinary":"https://public.tableau.com/views/StateandCountyDashboard/Dashboard1?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no&:host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F&:embed_code_version=3&:tabs=no&:toolbar=yes&:animate_transition=yes&:display_static_image=no&:display_spinner=no&:display_overlay=yes&:display_count=yes&:language=en&publish=yes&:loadOrderID=0","twitter":"@health_wyoming","covid19SiteOld":"https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Specimens","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"totalTestsViral","totalTestResultsField":"Total Tests (PCR)","pui":"No data","pum":false,"name":"Wyoming","fips":"56"}
