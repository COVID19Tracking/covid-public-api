{"state":"WY","notes":"Negatives = Total - Positive.\nThe week of April 6, Wyoming began separating confirmed & suspected cases; we now report only confirmed. \n\nFrom April 7 to April 13, our recovered count may be slightly high, as Wyoming combined recovered confirmed cases + recovered probable cases. \n\nOn April 22, Wyoming revised down total tests, resulting in a decrease in negatives. \n\nAs of April 28, we are including the suspected cases with the confirmed cases.\n\nAs of May 16, Wyoming is reporting specimens tested. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested.\n\nAs of June 19, Wyoming began reporting the number of people tested as well as the number of specimens tested. \n\nAs of June 20, we replaced test specimen data with people tested data. Total test numbers were impacted by around 10,000.","covid19Site":"https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-map-and-statistics/","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-testing-data/","twitter":"@health_wyoming","covid19SiteOld":"https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/","name":"Wyoming","fips":"56","pui":"","pum":false}
