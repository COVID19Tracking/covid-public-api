WY,"Negatives = Total - Positive.
The week of April 6, Wyoming began separating confirmed & suspected cases; we now report only confirmed. 

From April 7 to April 13, our recovered count may be slightly high, as Wyoming combined recovered confirmed cases + recovered probable cases. 

On April 22, Wyoming revised down total tests, resulting in a decrease in negatives. 

As of April 28, we are including the suspected cases with the confirmed cases.

As of May 16, Wyoming is reporting specimens tested. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested.

As of June 19, Wyoming began reporting the number of people tested as well as the number of specimens tested. 

As of June 20, we replaced test specimen data with people tested data. Total test numbers were impacted by around 10,000.",https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/,https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-map-and-statistics/,https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-testing-data/,@health_wyoming,https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/,Wyoming,56,,false
