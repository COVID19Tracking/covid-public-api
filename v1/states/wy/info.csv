WY,"Wyoming's metrics do not update every day, and don't always update together. As a result, please exercise extra caution when using numbers that are calculated from daily changes, especially if these calculations use multiple metrics.

Wyoming reports the number of people *Ever hospitalized* with COVID-19 as a percentage of “Lab Confirmed Cases by Reported Hospitalization” on their [Statistics page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-map-and-statistics/). In the absence of a better data source we convert this percentage to an integer, and as a result of the calculation, this value may fluctuate.

Negatives reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.

As of November 25, 2020, Wyoming's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. 

On November 25, 2020, we started collecting *Total PCR tests (specimens)* from the ""Wyoming Updates"" section of Wyoming's [COVID-19 page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/) and started collecting *Positive tests PCR (specimens)* and *Negative tests PCR (specimens)* from the values in the graph on the ""Laboratory Results by Date"" graph on their [COVID-19 State and County Dashboards page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-state-and-county-dashboards/). At the same time, we backfilled all three of the above time series based on the numbers from the second page, summing the positive and negative numbers to use for the historical totals.

On November 17, 2020, Wyoming’s Confirmed cases increased by more than their **Total PCR tests (specimens)** without explanation. As a result, **Negative PCR tests (people)**, which are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** decreased.

On October 14, 2020, Wyoming's **Total PCR Tests (specimens)** and **Total PCR Tests (people)** values both decreased by over 1000 with no explanation. We believe the state might have deduplicated its data.

On August 26, 2020, Wyoming did not report **Total PCR tests (people).** We have carried over the previous day's value.

On June 19, 2020, Wyoming began reporting **Total PCR tests (people)** as well as **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.

On April 28, 2020, we began to report **probable cases** together with **confirmed cases**.

During the week of April 7, 2020, Wyoming began to report both confirmed and probable cases in its Recovered metrics.

During the week of April 6, 2020, Wyoming began reporting confirmed and probable cases separately.
