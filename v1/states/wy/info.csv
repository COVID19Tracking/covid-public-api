WY,"During the week of April 6, 2020, Wyoming began reporting confirmed and probable cases separately.

During the week of April 7, 2020, Wyoming began to report both confirmed and probable cases in its Recovered metrics.

On April 22, 2020, Wyoming revised its **Total PCR tests (specimens)** downward, resulting in a corresponding decrease in the calculated value of **Negative PCR tests (specimens)**. 

On April 28, 2020, we began to report **probable cases** together with **confirmed cases**.

On June 19, 2020, Wyoming began reporting the **Total PCR tests (people)** as well as **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.

On August 26, 2020, Wyoming did not report **Total PCR tests (people).** We have carried over the previous day's value.

On October 14, 2020, Wyoming's **Total PCR Tests (specimens)** and **Total PCR Tests (people) values both decreased by over 1000 with no explanation. We believe the state might have deduplicated its data. 

Wyoming reports both **Positive tests PCR (specimens)** and **Negative tests PCR (specimens)** as percentages of **Total tests PCR**. We convert these percentages to integers. Wyoming reports the number of people currently hospitalized with COVID-19 in each hospital: we sum these values for the state total. Wyoming reports the number of people ever hospitalized with COVID-19 as a percentage: we convert this percentage to an integer. Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.
