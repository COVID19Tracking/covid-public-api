WY,"Wyoming reports **Positive tests PCR (specimens)** and **Negative tests PCR (specimens)** as percentages of **Total tests PCR** in the graph ""COVID-19 Resulted Tests by Result"" on their [Testing page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-testing-data/). Wyoming also reports the number of people **Ever hospitalized** with COVID-19 as a percentage of “Lab Confirmed Cases by Reported Hospitalization” on their [Statistics page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-map-and-statistics/). In the absence of better data we convert these percentages to integers, as a result of the calculation, these values may fluctuate. 

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.

On November 17, 2020, Wyoming’s Confirmed cases increased by more than their Total PCR tests (specimens) without explanation. As a result Negative test results which are calculated by subtracting Positive PCR tests (people) from Total PCR tests (specimens) decreased.

On October 14, 2020, Wyoming's **Total PCR Tests (specimens)** and **Total PCR Tests (people)** values both decreased by over 1000 with no explanation. We believe the state might have deduplicated its data.

On August 26, 2020, Wyoming did not report **Total PCR tests (people).** We have carried over the previous day's value.

On June 19, 2020, Wyoming began reporting **Total PCR tests (people)** as well as **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.

On April 28, 2020, we began to report **probable cases** together with **confirmed cases**.

On April 22, 2020, Wyoming revised its **Total PCR tests (specimens)** downward, resulting in a corresponding decrease in the calculated value of **Negative PCR tests (specimens)**. 

During the week of April 7, 2020, Wyoming began to report both confirmed and probable cases in its Recovered metrics.

During the week of April 6, 2020, Wyoming began reporting confirmed and probable cases separately.",https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/,https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-map-and-statistics/,https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-testing-data/,,,@health_wyoming,https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/,People,posNeg,posNeg,No data,false,Wyoming,56
