NJ,"On May 16, 2020, a backfill effort by New Jersey caused the state's data for **Recovered** to rise by approximately 7,000 people. 

On July 16, 2020, New Jersey's **Recovered** figure decreased.

On July 19, 2020, New Jersey's **Total cases** decreased, perhaps due to reclassification of probable cases.

On August 4, 2020, New Jersey's *Now hospitalized** number decreased by 268 people.

On August 7, 2020, we back-filled New Jersey's **Probable deaths** with data provided by the state. This removed apparent spikes in deaths due to the state's irregulat reporting.

On September 1, New Jersey did not update their total PCR test figure by the time of our update, however total cases increased from 191160 to 192290.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.",https://covid19.nj.gov/#live-updates,https://maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=c2efd1898e48452e83d7218329e953d7&entry=2,,,,@NJDeptofHealth,https://www.nj.gov/health/cd/topics/ncov.shtml,Specimens,posNeg,posNeg,New Jersey,34,,false
