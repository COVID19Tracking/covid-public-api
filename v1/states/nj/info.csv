NJ,"Positive count includes deaths. Hospitalization + ICU counts include both positive cases and persons under investigation. As of May 11, New Jersey is reporting total PCR specimens tested.

On May 16, New Jersey had a significant jump in recovered (about 7,000) due to backfilling previous days after a shift in how this figure was reported on April 28.

On June 25, New Jersey reported 1854 probable deaths that occurred in the past. This causes a perceived increase in the daily number of deaths.

On July 8, New Jersey reported another 89 probable deaths that occurred previously. This again artificially inflated the day's reported death toll. We are waiting to receive a dated time series from NJ to properly backfill the data.

On July 16, New Jersey decreased the number of cumulative recoveries.

On July 19, New Jersey reported 31 fewer cases than the preceding day. We believe this drop was due to reclassifying probable cases.

On July 20, New Jersey decreased the number of cumulative hospitalizations.

On July 22, New Jersey reported 54 fewer probable deaths than the preceding day. These deaths may have been reclassified as either due to COVID or not due to COVID.
