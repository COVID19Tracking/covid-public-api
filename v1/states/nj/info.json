{"state":"NJ","notes":"The **Recovered** data point we report for New Jersey reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.\n\nNegative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.\n\nOn October 22, New Jersey's reported **Ever hospitalized** value increased dramatically from 24,517 to 37,222 with no explanation we could find: this was probably a one-time addition of backlogged data.\n\nOn September 1, New Jersey did not update their total PCR test figure by the time of our update, however total cases increased from 191,160 to 192,290.\n\nOn August 7, 2020, we back-filled New Jersey's **Probable deaths** with data provided by the state. This removed apparent spikes in deaths due to the state's irregulat reporting.\n\nOn August 4, 2020, New Jersey's *Now hospitalized** number decreased by 268 people.\n\nOn July 19, 2020, New Jersey's **Total cases** decreased, perhaps due to reclassification of probable cases.\n\nOn July 16, 2020, New Jersey's **Recovered** figure decreased.\n\nOn May 16, 2020, a backfill effort by New Jersey caused the state's data for **Recovered** to rise by approximately 7,000 people.
