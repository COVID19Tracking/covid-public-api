{"state":"AZ","notes":"On June 23, 2020, we updated our historical data for **Cumulative hospitalized** to match Arizona's dashboard data for \"hospitalized by date admitted.\" Data for this metric is not typically reported until several days after admittance. Our daily updates will continue to compile Arizona’s overall number as of cumulative hospitalizations, regardless of date admitted.\n\nFrom July 18–August 5, 2020, Arizona’s dashboard stopped displaying confirmed and probable breakdowns for **cases** and **deaths**. We will backfill this data if Arizona provides historical numbers.\n\nOn July 28 and July 29, 2020, we noticed that Arizona's numbers for their **Now hospitalized** decreased slightly, while those for **Ever hospitalized** increased significantly. The state offered no explanation.\n\nOn August 30 and August 31, the Arizona Department of Health removed duplicate case records from their data. As a result, total deaths decreased by 1 on August 31, and cumulative hospitalizations decreased on August 30 and August 31.\n\nArizona regularly reviews and removes duplicate records which may occasionally result in minor decreases of cumulative figures.\n\nNegative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.","covid19Site":"https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/infectious-disease-epidemiology/covid-19/dashboards/index.php","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://tableau.azdhs.gov/views/Hospitalization/HospitalizedCOVID-19Cases?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no&:host_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftableau.azdhs.gov%2F&:embed_code_version=3&:tabs=no&:toolbar=no&:showAppBanner=false&:display_spinner=no&iframeSizedToWindow=true&:loadOrderID=3","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://tableau.azdhs.gov/views/ExternalEMResourceCOVIDSpecificDashboard/InpatientCOVID-19?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no&:host_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftableau.azdhs.gov%2F&:embed_code_version=3&:tabs=yes&:toolbar=no&:showAppBanner=false&:display_spinner=no&iframeSizedToWindow=true&:loadOrderID=4","twitter":"@azdhs","covid19SiteOld":"https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/infectious-disease-epidemiology/covid-19/dashboards/index.php","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Specimens","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"totalTestsViral","name":"Arizona","fips":"04","pui":"","pum":false}
