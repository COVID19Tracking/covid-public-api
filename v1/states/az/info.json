{"state":"AZ","notes":"Arizona combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state’s dashboard\n\nArizona regularly reviews and removes duplicate records which may occasionally result in minor decreases of cumulative figures. \n\nThe **Recovered** data point we report for Arizona reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.\n\nNegative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.\n\nOn October 6, 2020, The Arizona Department of Health Services [announced](https://directorsblog.health.azdhs.gov/covid-19-hospitalizations-in-arizona/?utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=AZDHS&utm_campaign=covid19,Director%27s+Blog&utm_content=3840149936&linkId=101333440) that they were removing cases who had been admitted to a hospital but had not been hospitalized from their total hospitalization counts. This results in a decrease of Arizona's cumulative hospitalizations.\n\nAs of September 25, 2020, Arizona’s total test timeseries is stored in our Total PCR Tests (People) field instead of Total PCR Tests (specimens), reflecting a response to our outreach to Arizona’s health department that it counts unique individuals tested. Arizona includes antigen tests in its totals figure, so if an individual received both an antigen and PCR test, they are counted only once. Additionally, as of September 25, 2020,  Arizona's total test results are drawn from our Total PCR Tests (People) field instead of calculated via positive+negative.\n\nOn September 18, 2020, Arizona reported a policy change in the way they count people with positive antigen testing results to comply with CSTE case definitions. This appears to have resulted in a large increase in probable cases and also likely the reason where a decrease in confirmed cases was observed. \n\nOn September 16, 2020, Arizona added antigen testing into its main totals figure. This appears to have raised its Total Tests (PCR) number more than usual.\n\nFrom July 18–August 5, 2020, Arizona’s dashboard stopped displaying confirmed and probable breakdowns for **cases** and **deaths**. We will backfill this data if Arizona provides historical numbers.\n\nOn June 23, 2020, we updated our historical data for **Cumulative hospitalized** to match Arizona's dashboard data for \"hospitalized by date admitted.\" Data for this metric is not typically reported until several days after admittance. Our daily updates will continue to compile Arizona’s overall number as of cumulative hospitalizations, regardless of date admitted.","covid19Site":"https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/infectious-disease-epidemiology/covid-19/dashboards/index.php","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://tableau.azdhs.gov/views/Hospitalization/HospitalizedCOVID-19Cases?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no&:host_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftableau.azdhs.gov%2F&:embed_code_version=3&:tabs=no&:toolbar=no&:showAppBanner=false&:display_spinner=no&iframeSizedToWindow=true&:loadOrderID=3","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://tableau.azdhs.gov/views/ExternalEMResourceCOVIDSpecificDashboard/InpatientCOVID-19?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no&:host_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftableau.azdhs.gov%2F&:embed_code_version=3&:tabs=yes&:toolbar=no&:showAppBanner=false&:display_spinner=no&iframeSizedToWindow=true&:loadOrderID=4","covid19SiteQuaternary":"https://tableau.azdhs.gov/views/ExternalEMResourceCOVIDSpecificDashboard/VentilatorsinUseCOVID-19?%3Aembed=y&%3AshowVizHome=no&%3Ahost_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftableau.azdhs.gov%2F&%3Aembed_code_version=3&%3Atabs=yes&%3Atoolbar=no&%3AshowAppBanner=false&%3Adisplay_spinner=no&iframeSizedToWindow=true&%3AloadOrderID=1","covid19SiteQuinary":null,"twitter":"@azdhs","covid19SiteOld":"https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/infectious-disease-epidemiology/covid-19/dashboards/index.php","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"People","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"totalTestsPeopleViral","totalTestResultsField":"Total PCR Tests (People)","pui":"All data","pum":false,"name":"Arizona","fips":"04"}
