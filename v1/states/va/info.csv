VA,"The **Recovered** data point we report for Virginia reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (test encounters)** in the absence of better data.

On December 8, 2020, Virginia’s Recovered decreased by 200 without explanation.

On December 5, 2020, Virginia announced that some of the cases reported on December 5, 2020 were part of a backlog. As a result, not all cases reported on December 5, 2020 were reported within the previous 24 hour period.

On December 2, 2020, we switched our source for Virginia’s Ever hospitalized, and shifted our entire time series for Virginia’s Ever hospitalized in order to more closely align with the reporting on Virginia’s COVID-19 dashboard.

As of September 18, 2020, Virginia's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

On August 31, 2020 we began publishing **Positive PCR tests (specimens)** for Virginia. This data has been collected daily since July 21, 2020. Previous data going back to February 27, 2020 was taken from state historical data as of July 21. Historical data for **Total PCR Tests (encounters)** before July 21, 2020 was updated based on the same dataset, extending the column back to February 27, 2020 as well.

On August 27, the VA dashboard did not update by our publish time. We are carrying over the values from August 26.

On Aug 7, 2020, due to the release of a backlog, Virginia reoprted an abnormally large **case** increase of around 2000.

As of May 15, 2020, Virginia is reporting PCR tests and antibody tests separately.
