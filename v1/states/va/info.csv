VA,"As of May 15, 2020, Virginia is reporting PCR tests and antibody tests separately. 

On Aug 7, 2020, due to the release of a backlog, Virginia reoprted an abnormally large **case** increase of around 2000.

On August 27, the VA dashboard did not update by our publish time. We are carrying over the values from August 26

On August 31, 2020 we began publishing **Positive PCR tests (specimens)** for Virginia. This data has been collected daily since July 21, 2020. Previous data going back to February 27, 2020 was taken from state historical data as of July 21. Historical data for **Total PCR Tests (encounters)** before July 21, 2020 was updated based on the same dataset, extending the column back to February 27, 2020 as well.

**Ever hospitalized** is calculated from the ""currently hospitalized"" and ""discharged"" data points on the Virginia Hospital COVID-19 dashboard. 

The **Recovered** data point we report for Virginia reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (test encounters)** in the absence of better data.

As of September 18, 2020, Virginia's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.
