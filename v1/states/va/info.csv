VA,Virginia,51,"Virginia hospitalization statistics from [Hospital dashboard](https://www.vhha.com/communications/virginia-hospital-covid-19-data-dashboard/)  We assume the count ""hospitalized in the ICU"" includes the count ""currently on a ventilator."" Cumulative Hospitalized is computed from currently hospitalized + discharged on the Virginia Hospitals dashboard. 
As of May 16, Virginia  is reporting specimens tested, including both a number of PCR tests and a total number of specimens tested (which also includes serology tests). Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested",https://public.tableau.com/views/VirginiaCOVID-19Dashboard/VirginiaCOVID-19Dashboard?:embed=yes&:display_count=yes&:showVizHome=no&:toolbar=no,https://www.vhha.com/communications/virginia-hospital-covid-19-data-dashboard/,http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/surveillance-and-investigation/novel-coronavirus/,@vdhgov,Positives + Negatives,true
