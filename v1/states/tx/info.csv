TX,"As of May 16, Texas is reporting mostly specimens tested, except for the small number of tests performed by public labs, which are de-duplicated.
As of May 23, Texas is separating out PCR and antibody tests; we report the number of PCR tests. Total tests might be impacted. 
TX notes that ""The reported cases for June 16 include 2,622 new cases and 1,476 cases that were previously diagnosed among Texas Department of Criminal Justice inmates but that had not been reported by local health departments (887 from Anderson County and 589 from Brazoria County).""
On July 22, we began reporting ICU hospitalizations for TX. We are currently looking through historical data to maintain an accurate time-series.
On July 23, Texas reported that there will be incomplete current hospitalization numbers due to its transition to the HHS reporting system. We are carrying over yesterday's data point to maintain a consistent time-series and will backfill with the updated numbers once available. On July 25, TX reported that 2092 probable cases had been removed from the statewide case totals by the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District. That removal meant that the number of total cases for TX appeared smaller than it was. The actual number of new cases in TX that day was 8112, not 6020.
