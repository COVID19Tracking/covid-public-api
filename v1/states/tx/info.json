{"state":"TX","notes":"The Texas Department of State Health Services regularly includes older cases identified by labs in their cumulative confirmed case counts. As a result, new cases reported may not necessarily have occurred in the past 24 hour period. When these increases are significant, we will specifically mention them in our daily update on twitter.\n\nNegative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.\n\nOn November 16, 2020, Texas announced that due to technical difficulties testing data would not be updated. In addition, the “DSHS will be unable to separate laboratory data for Nov. 15 and Nov. 16 for the following indicators: total tests reported…“. As a result, testing data for November 17, 2020 will include tests reported on November 15, 2020 and November 16, 2020.\n\nOn November 15, 2020, Texas did not update any testing metrics. \n\nOn November 11, 2020, Texas reported that their update to **Deaths (confirmed and probable)** would be delayed due to technical difficulties.\n\nOn September 14, 2020, Texas \"revised its method for reporting Total Tests,\" resulting in an approximately 300,000 unit decrease in **Total PCR tests (specimens)** and approximately 17,000 unit decrease in **Total antibody tests (specimens)**. We are currently investigating how this change affects our understanding of Texas' testing units.\n\nAs of August 16, 2020, several commercial laboratories submitted previously backlogged test results to the Texas Department of State Health Services. As a result, new confirmed cases may not have occurred in the past 24 hours. The Texas Department of State Health Services is working to resolve these issues.\n\nOn August 2, 2020, Texas noted that \"New data will not be posted on this dashboard on Sunday, August 2 due to a scheduled upgrade to the system that processes electronic lab reports. Data for Sunday will be posted with Monday’s data update.\"\n\nOn July 30, 2020, Texas noted that \"Cumulative fatalities have been corrected for July 27–29. As DSHS shifted to using death certificate data to count fatalities this week, an automation error caused approximately 225 fatalities to be included that did not have COVID-19 listed as a direct cause of death.\"\n\nOn July 27, 2020, Texas added 675 additional deaths through death certificate reviews. However only 44 deaths were truly \"new\" deaths on July 27. This will create a one-day artificial apparent daily increase in deaths.\n\nOn July 25, 2020, Texas reported that 2092 probable cases had been removed from the statewide case totals by the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District. That removal meant that the number of total cases for Texas app\n\nStarting July 23, 2020, Texas has reported that its current hospitalization and ICU numbers are incomplete due to its transition to the HHS reporting system. We carried over hospitalization figures until July 28. We will backfill the complete numbers for July 23–July 28 if the complete data becomes available.\n\nOn July 22, 2020, we began reporting **Currently in ICU** for Texas.
