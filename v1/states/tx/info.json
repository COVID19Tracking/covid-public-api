{"state":"TX","notes":"The Texas Department of State Health Services regularly includes older cases identified by labs in their cumulative confirmed case counts. As a result, new cases reported may not necessarily have occurred in the past 24 hour period. When these increases are significant, we will specifically mention them in our daily update on twitter.\n\nNegative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.\n\nOn September 14, 2020, Texas \"revised its method for reporting Total Tests,\" resulting in an approximately 300,000 unit decrease in **Total PCR tests (specimens)** and approximately 17,000 unit decrease in **Total antibody tests (specimens)**. We are currently investigating how this change affects our understanding of Texas' testing units.\n\nAs of August 16, 2020, several commercial laboratories submitted previously backlogged test results to the Texas Department of State Health Services.

As DSHS shifted to using death certificate data to count fatalities this week, an automation error caused approximately 225 fatalities to be included that did not have COVID-19 listed as a direct cause of death.\"\n\nOn July 27, 2020, Texas added 675 additional deaths through death certificate reviews. However only 44 deaths were truly \"new\" deaths on July 27. This will create a one-day artificial apparent daily increase in deaths.\n\nOn July 25, 2020, Texas reported that 2092 probable cases had been removed from the statewide case totals by the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District. That removal meant that the number of total cases for Texas app\n\nStarting July 23, 2020, Texas has reported that its current hospitalization and ICU numbers are incomplete due to its transition to the HHS reporting system. We carried over hospitalization figures until July 28. We will backfill the complete numbers for July 23–July 28 if the complete data becomes available.\n\nOn July 22, 2020, we began reporting **Currently in ICU** for Texas.
