{"state":"TX","notes":"As of May 16, Texas is reporting mostly specimens tested, except for the small number of tests performed by public labs, which are de-duplicated. \n\nAs of May 23, Texas is separating out PCR and antibody tests; we report the number of PCR tests. Total tests might be impacted. On June 16, Texas notes that \"The reported cases for June 16 include 2,622 new cases and 1,476 cases that were previously diagnosed among Texas Department of Criminal Justice inmates but that had not been reported by local health departments (887 from Anderson County and 589 from Brazoria County).\" \n\nOn July 22, we began reporting ICU hospitalizations for Texas. We are currently looking through historical data to maintain an accurate time-series. \n\nOn July 25, Texas reported that 2092 probable cases had been removed from the statewide case totals by the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District. That removal meant that the number of total cases for Texas appeared smaller than it was. The actual number of new cases in Texas that day was 8112, not 6020. \n\nOn July 27, Texas added 675 additional deaths through death certificate reviews. However only 44 deaths were truly new deaths on July 27. This will inflate the daily increase in deaths until the timeseries has been backfilled based on this revision \n\nStarting July 23, Texas has reported that its current hospitalization and ICU numbers are incomplete due to its transition to the HHS reporting system. We carried over hospitalization figures until July 28. We will backfill the complete numbers for July 23 - July 28 when reporting is back at 100%.\n\nOn July 30, Texas posted that \"Cumulative fatalities have been corrected for July 27, 28 and 29.  As DSHS shifted to using death certificate data to count fatalities this week, an automation error caused approximately 225 fatalities to be included that did not have COVID-19 listed as a direct cause of death.\"","covid19Site":"https://txdshs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/ed483ecd702b4298ab01e8b9cafc8b83","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://www.dshs.texas.gov/coronavirus/TexasCOVID-19HospitalizationsOverTimebyTSA.xlsx","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://txdshs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/0d8bdf9be927459d9cb11b9eaef6101f","twitter":"@TexasDSHS","covid19SiteOld":"https://dshs.texas.gov/coronavirus/","name":"Texas","fips":"48","pui":"","pum":false}
