DC,"On May 25, 2020, the District of Columbia decreased the district's **total tests** number by 11,000 to reflect only DC residents.

According to our outreach, the District of Columbia’s “total overall tested” figure on its dashboard represents test encounters, the number of unique individuals tested per day, with one exception: if an individual receives a positive and a negative test on the same day, they are counted twice rather than once. As of August 29, 2020, we store the “total overall tested” timeseries in our **Total PCR Tests (encounters)** field, despite this difference in definition.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people, confirmed + probable)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.",https://coronavirus.dc.gov/page/coronavirus-surveillance-data,,,@_DCHealth,https://coronavirus.dc.gov/,Encounters,totalTestEncountersViral,posNeg,District of Columbia,11,,false
