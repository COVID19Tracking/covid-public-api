DC,"On May 25, 2020, the District of Columbia decreased the district's **total tests** number by 11,000 to reflect only DC residents.

As of September 18, 2020, District of Columbia's total test results are drawn from our total`TestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

According to our outreach, the District of Columbia’s “total overall tested” figure on its dashboard represents test encounters, the number of unique individuals tested per day, with one exception: if an individual receives a positive and a negative test on the same day, they are counted twice rather than once. As of August 29, 2020, we store the “total overall tested” timeseries in our **Total PCR Tests (encounters)** field, despite this difference in definition.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people, confirmed + probable)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.",https://coronavirus.dc.gov/page/coronavirus-surveillance-data,https://coronavirus.dc.gov/page/hospital-status-data,https://microstrategy.dc.gov/MicroStrategyLibrary/app/E52A533B11EA01A28FE80080EFC53DA4/30FE682111EA6FB5A6620080EF357B1F/WEF49494DFBDE44548AFB2A631C5233CC--K46,,,@_DCHealth,https://coronavirus.dc.gov/,Encounters,totalTestEncountersViral,Total Test Encounters (PCR),All data,false,District of Columbia,11
