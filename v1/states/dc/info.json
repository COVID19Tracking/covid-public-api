As of August 29, 2020, we store the “total overall tested” timeseries in our **Total PCR Tests (encounters)** field, despite this difference in definition.\n\nNegative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people, confirmed + probable)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.","covid19Site":"https://coronavirus.dc.gov/page/coronavirus-surveillance-data","covid19SiteSecondary":null,"covid19SiteTertiary":null,"twitter":"@_DCHealth","covid19SiteOld":"https://coronavirus.dc.gov/","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Encounters","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"totalTestEncountersViral","totalTestResultsField":"Total Test Encounters (PCR)","pui":"All data","pum":false,"name":"District of Columbia","fips":"11"}
