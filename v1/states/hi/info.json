{"state":"HI","notes":"As of August 5, 2020, we are collecting **Now hospitalized**, **Now in ICU**, and **Now on ventilator** data from the Lt. Governor of Hawaii's Instagram account, as we have determined that these are official statistics not available elsewhere. We have backfilled our time series for all available data from this source.\n\nOn September 3, 2020, Hawaii included cases which had been previously diagnosed in their daily update due to an electronic laboratory reporting error.\" As a result, new cases reported may not have been diagnosed in the previous 24 hours.\n\nNegative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people, confirmed + probable)** from **Total PCR tests (people)** in the absence of better data.\n\nOn September 27, 2020, HI reported a near-doubling in recoveries. This change reflects new information about recoveries in the past, and not unusual recovery activity on that date.\n\nOn October 8, 2020, Hawaii revised their total PCR tests (specimens) down 1,504 tests. We did not notice any formal notification explaining this decrease in total PCR tests. The state also removed the number of Total Tests (in people) from their website. We are working towards clarifying a new source or restoring the current source.","covid19Site":"https://health.hawaii.gov/coronavirusdisease2019/","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://health.hawaii.gov/coronavirusdisease2019/what-you-should-know/current-situation-in-hawaii/","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://public.tableau.com/views/EpiCurveApr4/CSVDownload.csv?:showVizHome=no","covid19SiteQuaternary":"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/eb56a98b71324152a918e72d3ccdfc20/page/page_5/","covid19SiteQuinary":"https://hawaiicovid19.com/dashboard/","twitter":"@HIgov_Health","covid19SiteOld":"https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/advisories/novel-coronavirus-2019/","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"People","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"posNeg","totalTestResultsField":"posNeg","pui":"Only positives","pum":false,"name":"Hawaii","fips":"15"}
