HI,"As of August 5, 2020, we are collecting **Now hospitalized**, **Now in ICU**, and **Now on ventilator** data from the Lt. Governor of Hawaii's Instagram account, as we have determined that these are official statistics not available elsewhere. We have backfilled our time series for all available data from this source.

On September 3, 2020, Hawaii included cases which had been previously diagnosed in their daily update due to an electronic laboratory reporting error."" As a result, new cases reported may not have been diagnosed in the previous 24 hours.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people, confirmed + probable)** from **Total PCR tests (people)** in the absence of better data.

On September 27, 2020, HI reported a near-doubling in recoveries. This change reflects new information about recoveries in the past, and not unusual recovery activity on that date.",https://health.hawaii.gov/coronavirusdisease2019/,https://health.hawaii.gov/coronavirusdisease2019/what-you-should-know/current-situation-in-hawaii/,https://hawaiicovid19.com/,https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/eb56a98b71324152a918e72d3ccdfc20/page/page_5/,https://hawaiicovid19.com/dashboard/,@HIgov_Health,https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/advisories/novel-coronavirus-2019/,People,posNeg,posNeg,Hawaii,15,,false
