HI,"Hawaii’s data is on a 1 day lag in our timeseries due to consistently updating after 7:30 pm Eastern Time, when we publish our daily update.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people, confirmed + probable)** from **Total PCR tests (people)** in the absence of better data.

On November 10, 2020, we switched the source for Hawaii’s Currently Hospitalized to the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency’s COVID-19 dashboard. As a result, current hospitalizations decreased by 14.

As of October 9, 2020, Hawaii’s total test results are drawn from our totalTestEncountersViral field instead of calculated via positive+negative. 

As of October 7th, 2020, Hawaii has stopped reporting the number of unique people tested, which is available in our API as totalTestsPeopleViral. We will carry forward the last value as a lower bound.

On September 3, 2020, Hawaii included cases which had been previously diagnosed in their daily update due to an electronic laboratory reporting error."" As a result, new cases reported may not have been diagnosed in the previous 24 hours.

As of August 5, 2020, we are collecting **Now hospitalized**, **Now in ICU**, and **Now on ventilator** data from the Lt. Governor of Hawaii's Instagram account, as we have determined that these are official statistics not available elsewhere. We have backfilled our time series for all available data from this source.",https://health.hawaii.gov/coronavirusdisease2019/,https://health.hawaii.gov/coronavirusdisease2019/what-you-should-know/current-situation-in-hawaii/,https://public.tableau.com/views/EpiCurveApr4/CSVDownload.csv?:showVizHome=no,https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/eb56a98b71324152a918e72d3ccdfc20/page/page_5/,https://hawaiicovid19.com/dashboard/,@HIgov_Health,https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/advisories/novel-coronavirus-2019/,Encounters,totalTestEncountersViral,Total Test Encounters (PCR),Only positives,false,Hawaii,15
