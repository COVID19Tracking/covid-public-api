HI,"Hawaii’s data is on a 1 day lag in our timeseries due to consistently updating after 7:30 pm Eastern Time, when we publish our daily update.

On February 2, 2021, Hawaii's **Total PCR Tests (Test Encounters)** decreased by more than 15,000 and **Positive PCR Tests (specimens)** decreased by more than 150 without explanation. 

On January 26, 2021, Hawaii reported 60 Deaths (confirmed + probable), the many of which may be due to a [death record review](https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2021/01/25/state-finds-additional-covid-deaths-hawaii-following-records-review/). As a result, not all new deaths reported on January 26, 2021 may have been reported in the previous 24 hour period.

On December 25, 2020, Hawaii’s **Total PCR tests (test encounters)** decreased by 6184 without explanation.

On November 10, 2020, we switched the source for Hawaii’s **Currently Hospitalized** to the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency’s COVID-19 dashboard. As a result, current hospitalizations decreased by 14. 

On November 6, 2020, Hawaii removed the Recovered metric from their dashboards.  Due to this we cannot continue reporting **Recovered**, but the time series for this metric is available in the historical data and in our data downloads. 

As of October 9, 2020, Hawaii’s total test results are drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. 

On October 7, 2020, Hawaii stopped reporting **Total PCR tests (people)** and **Total PCR tests (specimens)** and began reporting **Total PCR tests (test encounters)**. Due to this we cannot continue reporting **Total tests PCR (people)**, **Total PCR tests (specimens)** and `negative`, which was calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (people)**, however the time series for the metrics are available in the historical data, and our data downloads. 

On September 3, 2020, Hawaii included cases which had been previously diagnosed in their daily update due to an electronic laboratory reporting error."" As a result, new cases reported may not have been diagnosed in the previous 24 hours.

As of August 5, 2020, we are collecting **Now hospitalized**, **Now in ICU**, and **Now on ventilator** data from the Lt. Governor of Hawaii's Instagram account, as we have determined that these are official statistics not available elsewhere. We have backfilled our time series for all available data from this source. On October 12, 2020, Hawaii made these metrics available on the state dashboard and we have used that source since.",https://health.hawaii.gov/coronavirusdisease2019/,https://health.hawaii.gov/coronavirusdisease2019/what-you-should-know/current-situation-in-hawaii/,https://hiema.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/9a19e1adeceb46c58185cb0396faf36b,https://hiema.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/9a19e1adeceb46c58185cb0396faf36b,https://hawaiicovid19.com/dashboard/,@HIgov_Health,https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/advisories/novel-coronavirus-2019/,Encounters,totalTestEncountersViral,Total Test Encounters (PCR),Only positives,false,Hawaii,15
