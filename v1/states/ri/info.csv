RI,"Rhode Island combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard.

As of August 17, 2020, our **Total tests** metrics include Rhode Island's **Total tests (in test encounters)**.

On September 25, 2020, Rhode Island removed 240 duplicate cases from its case count, resulting in a drop from 24,311 cases to 24,181. 

The **Recovered** data point we report for Rhode Island reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.",https://health.ri.gov/data/covid-19/,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c2QrNMz8pIbYEKzMJL7Uh2dtThOJa2j1sSMwiDo5Gz4/edit#gid=264100583,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c2QrNMz8pIbYEKzMJL7Uh2dtThOJa2j1sSMwiDo5Gz4/gviz/tq?tqx=out:csv&sheet=1592746937,,,@rihealth,https://health.ri.gov/diseases/respiratory/?parm=163,Encounters,totalTestEncountersViral,Total Test Encounters (PCR),All data,false,Rhode Island,44
