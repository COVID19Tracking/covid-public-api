{"state":"RI","notes":"Recovered numbers are from hospital discharges. Rhode Island updates Monday through Friday by noon. \n\nOn July 8, Rhode Island started reporting test numbers in people in addition to specimens. We backfilled the data from their CSV. Since people is the default reporting metric in CTP for tests, this represents a drop in tests from previous reporting of approximately 50k tests. The number of PCR tests, positives, and negatives is available in our API.","covid19Site":"https://health.ri.gov/data/covid-19/","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c2QrNMz8pIbYEKzMJL7Uh2dtThOJa2j1sSMwiDo5Gz4/edit#gid=264100583","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c2QrNMz8pIbYEKzMJL7Uh2dtThOJa2j1sSMwiDo5Gz4/gviz/tq?tqx=out:csv&sheet=1592746937","twitter":"@rihealth","covid19SiteOld":"https://health.ri.gov/diseases/respiratory/?parm=163","name":"Rhode Island","fips":"44","pui":"","pum":false}
