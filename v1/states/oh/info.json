{"state":"OH","notes":"Ohio continually updates its **Currently hospitalized / Now hospitalized** data which can cause slight differences between their historic data and ours. \n\nNegative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.\n\nOn November 18, 2020, November 19, 2020, and November 20, 2020, Ohio reported that their data for November 19, 2020 was incomplete due to thousands of pending reports.\n\nOn November 18, 2020, Ohio reported 5246480 Total PCR tests (specimens) - the same number that was reported on November 15, 2020, and a drop of roughly 102k tests from November 17, 2020.
