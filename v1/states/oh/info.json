{"state":"OH","notes":"Ohio continually updates its **Currently hospitalized / Now hospitalized** data which can cause slight differences between their historic data and ours. \n\nNegative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.\n\nOn November 26, 2020, Ohio announced on their COVID-19 dashboard that there would not be a data update on November 26, 2020 due to the Thanksgiving holiday. Additionally, the data that would normally have been reported on November 26, 2020 will be included in the November 27, 2020 update.\n\nOn November 23, 2020 Ohio announced that their data for November 23, 2020 would include two days worth of positive test results which were delated due to technical issues affecting lab reporting. Additionally, on November 23, 2020, Ohio did not update their Total PCR tests (specimens) by the time of our daily update. Because Negative PCR tests (specimens) is calculated by subtracting Positive PCR tests (people, confirmed + probable) from Total PCR tests (specimens), we did not update them on November 23, 2020.\n\nStarting on November 18, 2020 through the current day, Ohio has reported on their [COVID-19 page](https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/home)that their data for the day was incomplete due to thousands of pending reports. We will specifically announce when this note is no longer there.\n\nOn November 18, 2020, Ohio reported 5246480 Total PCR tests (specimens) - the same number that was reported on November 15, 2020, and a drop of roughly 102k tests from November 17, 2020. Because Ohio announced that their data for November 18, 2020 would be incomplete, and we suspect this decrease was a result of that, we did not update Total PCR tests (specimens), or Negative PCR tests (people) on November 18, 2020.\n","covid19Site":"https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/dashboards/overview/","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/dashboards/key-metrics/cases","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/dashboards/key-metrics/hospitalizations","covid19SiteQuaternary":null,"covid19SiteQuinary":null,"twitter":"@OHdeptofhealth","covid19SiteOld":"https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/odh/know-our-programs/Novel-Coronavirus/welcome/","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Unclear units","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"posNeg","totalTestResultsField":"posNeg","pui":"All data","pum":false,"name":"Ohio","fips":"39"}
