OH,"Ohio continually updates its **Currently hospitalized / Now hospitalized** data which can cause slight differences between their historic data and ours. 

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.

On November 18, 2020, Ohio reported 5246480 Total PCR tests (specimens) - the same number that was reported on November 15, 2020, and a drop of roughly 102k tests from November 17, 2020. Because Ohio announced that their data for November 18, 2020 would be incomplete, and we suspect this decrease was a result of that, we did not update Total PCR tests (specimens), or Negative PCR tests (people) on November 18, 2020.

On November 18, 2020, Ohio reported that their data for November 18, 2020 was incomplete due to thousands of pending reports.",https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/dashboards/overview/,https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/dashboards/key-metrics/cases,https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/dashboards/key-metrics/hospitalizations,,,@OHdeptofhealth,https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/odh/know-our-programs/Novel-Coronavirus/welcome/,Unclear units,posNeg,posNeg,All data,false,Ohio,39
