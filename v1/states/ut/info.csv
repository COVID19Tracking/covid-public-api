UT,"Utah combines PCR and antigen tests in the top-line total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard. We get our cumulative PCR and antigen testing numbers from summing the daily testing figures on a graph with a timeseries that Utah continuously revises. We do our best to capture any backfilling manually, but the graph does not have an option to download the data automatically, which would allow us to better capture these revisions.

As of June 11, 2020, Utah reports a combined case count for total intubated patients and patients on a ventilator. We report this figure as **Ever on ventilator**.

As of July 16, 2020, Utah is reporting both specimens and people tested. We report positives and negatives based on the number of people tested. 

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.
