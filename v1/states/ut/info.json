{"state":"UT","notes":"\nOn November 6, 2020, we switched our source for Utahâ€™s Total PCR tests (people) to avoid reporting a mixed antigen and pcr test number. As a result Total PCR tests (people) and Negative PCR tests (people), which was previously calculated by subtracting Positive PCR tests (people) from Total PCR tests (people), decreased.\n\nAs of October 28, 2020, our Total Tests (PCR) and Positive Tests (PCR) for Utah are derived from the data download available on the Utah dashboard, which separates PCR and antigen tests. Total Tests (PCR) is calculated by adding positive and negative PCR tests from this [download](https://coronavirus-dashboard.utah.gov/Utah_COVID19_data.zip).\n\nAs of October 29, 2020, Utah's `totalTestResults` field represents encounters instead of pos+neg. The number of unique people ever tested remains available in the `totalTestsPeopleViral` field. \n\nAs of July 16, 2020, Utah is reporting both specimens and people tested. We report positives and negatives based on the number of people tested.\n\nAs of June 11, 2020, Utah reports a combined case count for total intubated patients and patients on a ventilator. We report this figure as **Ever on ventilator**.","covid19Site":"https://coronavirus-dashboard.utah.gov/","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://coronavirus-dashboard.utah.gov/#hospitalizations-mortality","covid19SiteTertiary":null,"covid19SiteQuaternary":null,"covid19SiteQuinary":null,"twitter":"@utahdepofhealth","covid19SiteOld":"https://health.utah.gov/coronavirus","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Specimens","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"totalTestsViral","totalTestResultsField":"Total Tests (PCR)","pui":"Only positives","pum":false,"name":"Utah","fips":"49"}
