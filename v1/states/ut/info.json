{"state":"UT","notes":"Utah combines PCR and antigen tests in the top-line total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard. The state does provide antigen and PCR tests results in a stacked bar chart on the dashboard, but the numbers can only be obtained by rolling over tiny targets on the provided bars, making them very difficult to record and verify. We have requested complete historical antigen and PCR testing data from the state.\n\nAs of June 11, 2020, Utah reports a combined case count for total intubated patients and patients on a ventilator. We report this figure as **Ever on ventilator**.\n\nAs of July 16, 2020, Utah is reporting both specimens and people tested. We report positives and negatives based on the number of people tested. \n\nNegative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.","covid19Site":"https://coronavirus-dashboard.utah.gov/","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://coronavirus-dashboard.utah.gov/#hospitalizations","covid19SiteTertiary":"","twitter":"@utahdepofhealth","covid19SiteOld":"https://health.utah.gov/coronavirus","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"People","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"posNeg","name":"Utah","fips":"49","pui":"","pum":false}
