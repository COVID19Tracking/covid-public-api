{"state":"IN","notes":"Indiana combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard.\n\nNegative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people, confirmed + probable)** from **Total PCR tests (people)** in the absence of better data.\n\nOn November 29, 2020, Indiana announced that a historical backlog of roughly 2200 Total PCR tests (people) and about 4000 Total PCR tests (specimens) would be included in their data for November 29, 2020. Negative PCR tests (people), which are calculated as Total PCR tests (people) minus Cases (confirmed + probable) will also be affected. As a result, new tests reported on November 29, 2020 were not all reported in the previous 24 hour period.\n\nAs of October 16, 2020, Indianaâ€™s total test results are drawn from our totalTestsViral field instead of calculated via positive+negative.","covid19Site":"https://www.in.gov/isdh/28470.htm","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://www.regenstrief.org/covid-dashboard/","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://hub.mph.in.gov/dataset/covid-19-beds-and-vents/resource/882a7426-886f-48cc-bbe0-a8d14e3012e4/view/05961851-c7ab-4ac7-92bf-fdf9881ecdab","covid19SiteQuaternary":null,"covid19SiteQuinary":null,"twitter":"@statehealthin","covid19SiteOld":"https://www.in.gov/isdh/28470.htm","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Specimens","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"totalTestsViral","totalTestResultsField":"Total Tests (PCR)","pui":"Only positives","pum":false,"name":"Indiana","fips":"18"}
