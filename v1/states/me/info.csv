ME,"Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.

On November 26, 2020, Maine announced on their COVID-19 page that there would only be partial updates to their data from November 26, 2020 to November 29, 2020 due to the Thanksgiving holiday. As a result, we were unable to update testing data, and current hospitalization data on November 26, 2020, and unable to update all data points except for Currently hospitalized, Currently in ICU, and Currently on ventilator on November 27, 2020.

On November 11, 2020, Maine did not update testing and hospitalization data: only **Cases,** **Deaths,** and **Recovered** were updated.

On November 2, 2020, Maine started reporting antigen and molecular tests separately on the state's dashboard.

On June 23, 2020, Maine began reporting the dates of **cases**, **deaths**, **recoveries**, and **hospitalizations** on the day they occurred instead of the day the event was reported. Maine also began providing separate figures for **Deaths (probable)** and **Deaths (confirmed)**.

As of May 20, 2020, Maine reports PCR tests and antibody tests separately.",https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/airborne/coronavirus/data.shtml,https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/airborne/coronavirus/data.shtml,https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/airborne/coronavirus/data.shtml,https://analytics.maine.gov/t/CDCExternal/views/covid-19-maine-cdc-dashboard-nav-buttons/1_Casetrendsbycounty?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no&:host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.maine.gov%2F&:embed_code_version=3&:tabs=no&:toolbar=yes&:showAppBanner=false&:display_spinner=no&:loadOrderID=1,https://analytics.maine.gov/t/CDCExternal/views/covid-19-maine-cdc-dashboard-nav-buttons/1_Casetrendsbycounty?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no&:host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.maine.gov%2F&:embed_code_version=3&:tabs=no&:toolbar=yes&:showAppBanner=false&:display_spinner=no&:loadOrderID=1,@mainedhhs,https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/airborne/coronavirus.shtml,Specimens,posNeg,posNeg,Only positives,false,Maine,23
