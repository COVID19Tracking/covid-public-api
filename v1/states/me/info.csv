ME,"Maine combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard.

As of May 20, 2020, Maine reports PCR tests and antibody tests separately.

On June 23, 2020, Maine began reporting the dates of **cases**, **deaths**, **recoveries**, and **hospitalizations** on the day they occurred instead of the day the event was reported. Maine also began providing separate figures for **Deaths (probable)** and **Deaths (confirmed)**.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.",https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/airborne/coronavirus/data.shtml,,,@mainedhhs,https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/airborne/coronavirus.shtml,Specimens,posNeg,,Only positives,false,Maine,23
