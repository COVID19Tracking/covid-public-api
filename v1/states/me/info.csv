ME,"As of May 13, Maine is reporting total specimens tested; this number is updated once a week on Wednesdays. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested.
As of May 20, Maine is separating out PCR tests and antibody tests; we report the number of PCR tests. Total testing numbers might be impacted.",https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/airborne/coronavirus.shtml,,@mainedhhs,Maine,23
