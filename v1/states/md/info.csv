MD,"As of October 16, 2020, Marylandâ€™s total test results are drawn from our totalTestsViral field instead of calculated via positive+negative. This will result in TotalTestResults only going back to 3/24 instead of 3/5.

On August 31 2020 , we updated Maryland's **Total PCR tests (specimens)** and **Positive PCR tests (specimens)**  prior to 8/16 to match state-provided ""Testing Volume"" data.

On July 31, 2020, we began capturing Maryland's data for **Positive PCR tests (specimens)**.  

Between March 12 and March 28, 2020, Maryland did not report data for **negative tests**.",https://coronavirus.maryland.gov/,https://services.arcgis.com/njFNhDsUCentVYJW/arcgis/rest/services/MDCOVID19_TestingVolume/FeatureServer/0/query?where=1%3D1&outFields=*&outStatistics=[%7B%22statisticType%22%3A+%22sum%22%2C+%22onStatisticField%22%3A+%22number_of_positives%22%2C+%22outStatisticFieldName%22%3A+%22total_number_of_positives%22%7D],https://services.arcgis.com/njFNhDsUCentVYJW/arcgis/rest/services/MDCOVID19_SerologyTests/FeatureServer/0/query?where=1%3D1&outFields=%2A,,,@MDHealthDept,https://phpa.health.maryland.gov/Pages/Novel-coronavirus.aspx,Specimens,totalTestsViral,Total Tests (PCR),All data,false,Maryland,24
