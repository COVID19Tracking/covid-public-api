MD,"Between March 12 and March 28, 2020, Maryland did not report data for **negative tests**.

On July 31, 2020, we began capturing Maryland's data for **Positive PCR tests (specimens)**. On August 31 2020 , we updated Maryland's **Total PCR tests (specimens)** and **Positive PCR tests (specimens)**  prior to 8/16 to match state-provided ""Testing Volume"" data.

As of October 16, 2020, Maryland’s total test results are drawn from our totalTestsViral field instead of calculated via positive+negative. This will result in TotalTestResults only going back to 3/24 instead of 3/5.
