{"state":"DE","notes":"On October 29, 2020, we moved the data in our **Total Tests (PCR)** field for Delaware to the **Total Test Encounters (PCR)** field after learning that it represents encounters from Delaware's state health department. However, Delaware appears to include antigen tests in its totals, so if an individual is tested using two different test types on the same day, it will get counted twice. Also as of October 29, 2020, Delaware's `totalTestResults` field represents encounters. The number of unique people ever tested remains available in the `totalTestsPeopleViral` field.  \n\nOn September 9, 2020, Delaware reported that  data from September 8, 2020 and September 9, 2020 would not be available until September 10, 2020 due to a maintenance issue with their electronic reporting system. We will backfill data for September 8, 2020 and September 9, 2020 to the best of our abilities when data is released\n\nOn September 6, 2020, the Division of Public Health reported a technical issue which caused between 175-200 positive cases to be excluded from Delaware's cumulative confirmed case count. These cases will be added in the coming days. As a result new cases reported may not have been diagnosed in the past 24 hour period.\n\nOn August 27, 2020, Delaware revised down total cases and confirmed positives. This is a semi-regular occurrence which will impact Delware's number occasionally. \n\nOn July 25, 2020, Delaware revised down total cases, confirmed positives, and total tests.\n\nOn April 11, 2020, Delaware revised down negative test results from 10,415 to 9,624.","covid19Site":"https://myhealthycommunity.dhss.delaware.gov/locations/state#testing","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://myhealthycommunity.dhss.delaware.gov/locations/state#testing","covid19SiteTertiary":null,"covid19SiteQuaternary":null,"covid19SiteQuinary":null,"twitter":"@Delaware_DHSS","covid19SiteOld":"https://dhss.delaware.gov/dhss/dph/epi/2019novelcoronavirus.html","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Encounters","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"totalTestEncountersViral","totalTestResultsField":"Total Test Encounters (PCR)","pui":"All data","pum":false,"name":"Delaware","fips":"10"}
