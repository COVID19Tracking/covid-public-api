FL,"We compile much of our daily update from machine queries against the Florida Department of Health's raw data, some of which is not displayed on its [dashboard](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/96dd742462124fa0b38ddedb9b25e429/). This raw data includes information about Florida non-residents, which we include in our reporting, while the state of Florida's dashboard displays only Florida-resident data for some metrics.

On March 21, 2020, Florida began including tests of people not investigated as PUIs in its **Negative PCR tests** metric. 

As of May 15, 2020, Florida appears to report **total tests** in people and in units that resemble specimens (for both PCR and antibody tests, reported separately). We continue to attempt to clarify how all of Florida's testing data is deduplicated.

As of July 2, 2020, Florida reports PCR and antigen tests together.

As of July 10, 2020, Florida reports **Now hospitalized** data for those patients with a ""primary diagnosis of COVID-19.""

On August 12, 2020, the Florida Department of Health reported via Twitter that it had received a large backlog of testing data from Niznik Lab Corp in Miami: ""The lab reported over 4000 cases occurring over the last 7 weeks, but which had not been reported to FDOH until today. Therefore, this backlog severely skews today's daily report for Miami-Dade and is not reflective of current trends.""

[Per reporting](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241882491.html), the number of **pending tests** (available in our API and CSVs) may include only results from public labs, and may therefore be an undercount.",https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/96dd742462124fa0b38ddedb9b25e429/,https://o-vid.herokuapp.com/florida,https://bi.ahca.myflorida.com/t/ABICC/views/Public/COVIDHospitalizationsCounty?%3AshowAppBanner=false&%3Adisplay_count=n&%3AshowVizHome=n&%3Aorigin=viz_share_link&%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&%3Aembed=y,@HealthyFla,http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/COVID-19/,Florida,12,,false
