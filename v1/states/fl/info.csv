FL,"Florida combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard (first noted July 2, 2020). We include data about Florida non-residents in all metrics where possible. For some metrics, we use machine queries against the Florida Department of Health's raw data, which may not be displayed on its [dashboard](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/96dd742462124fa0b38ddedb9b25e429/).

On March 21, 2020, Florida began including tests of people not investigated as PUIs in its **Negative PCR tests** metric. 

Since May 15, 2020, Florida reports total tests in unique people and in unique people tested per lab. For that latter number, if an individual is tested twice by one lab, they only get counted once, but if an individual gets tested twice at different labs, they get counted twice. We store the former value in **Total PCR Tests (People)**, and the latter value, which does not match any of our totals units, in **Total Tests (PCR)**, our specimens field, where we also store testing data with unclear units. This value does **not** represent the number of specimens.

As of July 10, 2020, Florida reports **Now hospitalized** data for those patients with a ""primary diagnosis of COVID-19.""

On August 12, 2020, the Florida Department of Health reported via Twitter that it had received a large backlog of testing data from Niznik Lab Corp in Miami: ""The lab reported over 4,000 cases occurring over the last 7 weeks, but which had not been reported to FDOH until today. Therefore, this backlog severely skews today's daily report for Miami-Dade and is not reflective of current trends.""

On August 14, 2020, Florida began distinguishing between people with positive antigen tests and people with positive PCR tests in the Total Cases number given in their daily state report. As of September 30, 2020, we have removed these antigen positives from the values for **Cases or Positive PCR tests (people)** (_positiveCasesViral_ in our API), so the values for this metric in our time series will be lower. **Cases (confirmed plus probable)** (_positive_ in our API) will be unaffected.

On September 1, 2020, the Florida Department of Health [announced](http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/09/090120-1112-covid19.pr.html) that Quest Diagnostics had reported nearly 75,000 backlogged tests dating as far back as April.

On October 10, 2020, Florida did not report COVID-19 data. The state initially reported that this was because Helix Laboratory, a private lab, submitted 400,000 previously submitted results, which required extra deduplication time. On October 12, 2020, [the Florida Department of Health announced](http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/10/101220-1127-covid19.pr.html) that the error was not the fault of the private lab, but was due to ""an unforeseen technical issue"" that was ""not the fault of Helix or the Department of Health."" The state's data for October 11, 2020 appears to include data from both October 10 and 11.

As of October 13, 2020, Florida's Antigen positive timeseries is stored in our **Probable cases** field, reflecting a response to our outreach to Florida's health department that it switches Antigen positive cases to PCR positive cases in their daily state report upon confirmatory PCR testing.

On October 21, 2020, only some of Florida's data updated by our publication time. Data points such as **Total PCR Tests (People)** did not update.

[Per reporting](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241882491.html), the number of **pending tests** (available in our API and CSVs) may include only results from public labs, and may therefore be an undercount.",https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/96dd742462124fa0b38ddedb9b25e429/,https://floridahealthcovid19.gov/,https://bi.ahca.myflorida.com/t/ABICC/views/Public/COVIDHospitalizationsCounty?%3AshowAppBanner=false&%3Adisplay_count=n&%3AshowVizHome=n&%3Aorigin=viz_share_link&%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&%3Aembed=y,,,@HealthyFla,http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/COVID-19/,People,posNeg,posNeg,All data,false,Florida,12
