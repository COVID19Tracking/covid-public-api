{"state":"FL","notes":"We report using the raw data provided by FDOH but we include both Florida residents and non-residents.\nOn March 26, the dashboard stopped including non-residents in its visible counts, but they're still tracked behind the scenes.  \nOn March 21, negatives jumped due to a methodology change: tests of people not investigated as PUIs are now included. \nAs of May 15, Florida is reporting both specimens (PCR and antibody) and people tested. We report positives and negatives based on the number of people tested. However, the \"people tested\" number reported on Florida's dashboard has come into question as of May 31, because this number is not fully de-duplicated. Florida's report states that: \"People tested on multiple days will be included for each day a new result was received.\"\nAs of July 10, Florida is reporting current hospitalizations as those with a \"primary diagnosis of COVID-19.\"","covid19Site":"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/96dd742462124fa0b38ddedb9b25e429/","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://o-vid.herokuapp.com/florida","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://bi.ahca.myflorida.com/t/ABICC/views/Public/HospitalBedsCounty?%3AshowAppBanner=false&%3Adisplay_count=n&%3AshowVizHome=n&%3Aorigin=viz_share_link&%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&%3Aembed=y","twitter":"@HealthyFla","covid19SiteOld":"http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/COVID-19/","name":"Florida","fips":"12","pui":"","pum":false}
