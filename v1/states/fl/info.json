{"state":"FL","notes":"Florida combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard (first noted July 2, 2020). We include data about Florida non-residents in all metrics where possible. For some metrics, we use machine queries against the Florida Department of Health's raw data, which may not be displayed on its [dashboard](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/96dd742462124fa0b38ddedb9b25e429/).\n\nOn March 21, 2020, Florida began including tests of people not investigated as PUIs in its **Negative PCR tests** metric. \n\nAs of May 15, 2020, Florida appears to report **total tests** in people and in units that resemble specimens (for both PCR and antibody tests, reported separately). We continue to attempt to clarify how all of Florida's testing data is deduplicated.\n\nAs of July 10, 2020, Florida reports **Now hospitalized** data for those patients with a \"primary diagnosis of COVID-19.\"\n\nOn August 12, 2020, the Florida Department of Health reported via Twitter that it had received a large backlog of testing data from Niznik Lab Corp in Miami: \"The lab reported over 4000 cases occurring over the last 7 weeks, but which had not been reported to FDOH until today. Therefore, this backlog severely skews today's daily report for Miami-Dade and is not reflective of current trends.\"\n\nOn September 1, 2020, the Florida Department of Health [announced](http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/09/090120-1112-covid19.pr.html) that Quest Diagnostics had reported nearly 75,000 backlogged tests dating as far back as April.\n\n[Per reporting](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241882491.html), the number of **pending tests** (available in our API and CSVs) may include only results from public labs, and may therefore be an undercount.","covid19Site":"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/96dd742462124fa0b38ddedb9b25e429/","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://floridahealthcovid19.gov/","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://bi.ahca.myflorida.com/t/ABICC/views/Public/COVIDHospitalizationsCounty?%3AshowAppBanner=false&%3Adisplay_count=n&%3AshowVizHome=n&%3Aorigin=viz_share_link&%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&%3Aembed=y","twitter":"@HealthyFla","covid19SiteOld":"http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/COVID-19/","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"People","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"posNeg","name":"Florida","fips":"12","pui":"","pum":false}
