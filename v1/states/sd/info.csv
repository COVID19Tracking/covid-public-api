SD,"On November 26, 2020, South Dakota [announced](https://twitter.com/SDDOH/status/1332017785560576001?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) via the official South Dakota Department of Health that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020. Additionally, data for both November 26, 2020 and November 27, 2020, will be published on November 27, 2020.

On October, 7, 2020 South Dakota started reporting **Probable cases**. This added 473 new cases to South Dakota's **Total cases** number.

As of September 18, 2020, South Dakota's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsPeopleViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

On August 27, the South Dakota Department of Health included cases from August 25 and 26 in their update due to a reporting aberration, resulting in a 343 case increase. They have provided historical case counts, and we are working to backfill our data.

On July 27, 2020, **Negative PCR tests** decreased by 148 for unclear reasons.",https://doh.sd.gov/news/Coronavirus.aspx,,,,,@SDDOH,https://doh.sd.gov/news/Coronavirus.aspx,People,totalTestsPeopleViral,Total PCR Tests (People),All data,false,South Dakota,46
