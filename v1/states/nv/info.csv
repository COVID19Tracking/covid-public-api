NV,"Individual data fields have different update times; we use the latest as our ""Last Update"" time. Until May 10, hospitalizations, ICU bed usage, and ventilator usage were reported as a percentage of total capacity in daily situation reports, but total capacity is not published, so we did not estimate those numbers. 

As of May 6, Nevada is reporting both specimens and people tested. We report positives and negatives based on the number of people tested.
