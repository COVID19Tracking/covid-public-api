{"state":"NV","notes":"Individual data fields have different update times; we use the latest as our \"Last Update\" time. Hospitalizations, ICU bed usage, and ventilator usage are reported as a percentage of total capacity in daily situation reports, but total capacity is not published, so we do not estimate those numbers. As of May 6, Nevada is reporting both specimens and people tested. We report positives and negatives based on the number of people tested.
