{"state":"CO","notes":"On May 15, Colorado started reporting deaths for which COVID-19 is listed on the death certificate, in addition to the figure it already provided, deaths among laboratory-confirmed and probable cases (whether or not COVID was a cause of death). On July 1, 2020, we revised our historical data to reflect the death-certificate metric instead of the deaths-among-cases metric. Because of this change in methodology, there is a drop from 1,091 deaths on May 15 to 878 on May 16 in our data. Colorado also reports subsets of confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths, but these metrics correspond to the deaths-among-cases metric we no longer report, so we do not compile this data.\n\nOn June 14, 2020, Colorado revised previous \"daily discharged\" numbers. This caused an overall decline in their **Recovered** data.\n\nOn July 27, 2020, Colorado posted a notice that, \"Due to a server issue yesterday and today with our electronic laboratory reporting system, the number of tests completed and cases reported today, July 27, 2020, may be artificially low.\" We report Colorado data a day after posting due to timing, so this note applies to the data published on July 28.\n\nAs of August 13, 2020, Colorado's **total test results** reflect total test encounters. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as `totalTestsPeopleViral`.\n\nNegative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.","covid19Site":"https://covid19.colorado.gov/data","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://public.tableau.com/views/Colorado_COVID19_Data/CO_Hospital?%3Aembed=y&%3AshowVizHome=no","covid19SiteTertiary":"","covid19SiteQuaternary":"","covid19SiteQuinary":"","twitter":"@cdphe","covid19SiteOld":"https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/2019-novel-coronavirus","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Encounters","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"totalTestEncountersViral","totalTestResultsField":"Total Test Encounters (PCR)","name":"Colorado","fips":"08","pui":"","pum":false}
