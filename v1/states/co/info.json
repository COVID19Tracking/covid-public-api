{"state":"CO","notes":"Negative = People Tested - Cases. Cases include people who test positive for COVID-19 AND people who have symptoms of COVID-19 and are a close contact to someone who tested positive. While Colorado publishes a confirmed/probable breakdown, this breakdown pertains to cases resulting in deaths rather than death certificates with COVID-19 listed as a contributing cause. As such, we do not count from it to maintain consistency with the total deaths figure from death certificates.\nAs of April 27, Colorado is reporting people tested. \nOn June 14, Colorado revised some previous daily discharged number. This caused an overall decline in their recovered count. \nOn May 15 (which we caught on our update May 16), Colorado started providing a new figure for deaths where COVID-19 is listed on the death certificate, in addition to the figure it already provided, deaths among laboratory-confirmed and probable cases (whether or not COVID was a cause of death). On July 1, we revised our historical data to reflect the deaths certificate figure instead of the deaths among cases. As such, it appears as if there is a drop from 1091 deaths on May 15 to 878 on May 16 in our data. \nOn July 16, Colorado decreased the cumulative hospitalization number by 13.\nOn July 27, Colorado posted a notice that, \"Due to a server issue yesterday and today with our electronic laboratory reporting system, the number of tests completed and cases reported today, July 27, may be artificially low.\" We report Colorado data a day after posting due to timing, so this note applies to the data published on July 28.","covid19Site":"https://covid19.colorado.gov/case-data","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://covid19.colorado.gov/covid-19-data","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://covid19.colorado.gov/hospital-data","twitter":"@cdphe","covid19SiteOld":"https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/2019-novel-coronavirus","name":"Colorado","fips":"08","pui":"","pum":false}
