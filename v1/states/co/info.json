{"state":"CO","notes":"Negative = People Tested - Cases. Cases include people who test positive for COVID-19 AND people who have symptoms of COVID-19 and are a close contact to someone who tested positive. While Colorado publishes a confirmed/probable breakdown, this breakdown pertains to cases resulting in deaths rather than death certificates with COVID-19 listed as a contributing cause. As such, we do not count from it to maintain consistency with the total deaths figure from death certificates.\nAs of April 27, Colorado is reporting people tested. On 6/14, CO revised some previous daily discharged number. This caused an overall decline in their recovered count. On 5/15 (which we caught on our update 5/16), Colorado started providing a new figure for deaths where COVID-19 is listed on the death certificate, in addition to the figure it already provided, deaths among laboratory-confirmed and probable cases (whether or not COVID was a cause of death). On 7/1, we revised our historical data to reflect the deaths certificate figure instead of the deaths among cases. As such, it appears as if there is a drop from 1091 deaths on 5/15 to 878 on 5/16 in our data. \nOn July 16, CO decreased the cumulative hospitalization number by 13.\nOn July 27th, Colorado posted a notice that, \"Due to a server issue yesterday and today with our electronic laboratory reporting system, the number of tests completed and cases reported today, July 27, may be artificially low.\" Covidtracking reports Colorado data a day after posting, so this note applies to the data published on Covidtracking on July 28.","covid19Site":"https://covid19.colorado.gov/case-data","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://covid19.colorado.gov/covid-19-data","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://covid19.colorado.gov/hospital-data","twitter":"@cdphe","covid19SiteOld":"https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/2019-novel-coronavirus","name":"Colorado","fips":"08","pui":"","pum":false}
