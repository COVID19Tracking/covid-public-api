CO,"Negative = People Tested - Cases. Cases include people who test positive for COVID-19 AND people who have symptoms of COVID-19 and are a close contact to someone who tested positive. While Colorado publishes a confirmed/probable breakdown, this breakdown pertains to cases resulting in deaths rather than death certificates with COVID-19 listed as a contributing cause. As such, we do not count from it to maintain consistency with the total deaths figure from death certificates.
As of April 27, Colorado is reporting people tested. On 6/14, CO revised some previous daily discharged number. This caused an overall decline in their recovered count. On 5/15 (which we caught on our update 5/16), Colorado started providing a new figure for deaths where COVID-19 is listed on the death certificate, in addition to the figure it already provided, deaths among laboratory-confirmed and probable cases (whether or not COVID was a cause of death). On 7/1, we revised our historical data to reflect the deaths certificate figure instead of the deaths among cases. As such, it appears as if there is a drop from 1091 deaths on 5/15 to 878 on 5/16 in our data. 
On July 16, CO decreased the cumulative hospitalization number by 13.",https://covid19.colorado.gov/case-data,https://covid19.colorado.gov/covid-19-data,https://covid19.colorado.gov/hospital-data,@cdphe,https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/2019-novel-coronavirus,Colorado,08,,false
