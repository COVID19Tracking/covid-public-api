KY,"On May 23, 2020, Kentucky revised down the state's figure for **Total tests**.

As of May 27, 2020, Kentucky reports antibody tests separately from PCR tests. 

As of September 18, 2020, Kentucky's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.
