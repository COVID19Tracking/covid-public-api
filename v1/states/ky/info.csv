KY,"Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.

On November 7, 2020, Kentucky [reported](https://chfs.ky.gov/cvdaily/COVID19DailyReport1107.pdf) that ""due to a keystroke error, the PCR and total tested figures were incorrectly  reported on 11/6/2020."" This caused our **Total PCR tests (specimens)** to go up by ~168k on November 6, and to go down by ~130k on November 7. If we find an official source with a corrected value we will backfill it.

As of September 18, 2020, Kentucky's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

As of May 27, 2020, Kentucky reports antibody tests separately from PCR tests. 

On May 23, 2020, Kentucky revised down the state's figure for **Total tests**.",https://govstatus.egov.com/kycovid19,https://chfs.ky.gov/agencies/dph/covid19/COVID19DailyReport.pdf,,,,@CHFSKy,https://chfs.ky.gov/agencies/dph/Pages/covid19.aspx,Specimens,totalTestsViral,Total Tests (PCR),All data,false,Kentucky,21
