TN,"Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.

Tennessee continually updates its **Currently hospitalized / Now hospitalized** data which can cause differences between their historic data and ours.

On December 25, 2020, Tennessee did not provide a data update by the time of our daily update, likely due to the holiday. We were able to update **Now hospitalized** from Tennessee’s separate [hospitalization source](https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov/data/hospitalization-data/current-covid-hospitalizations.html). Additionally, they [noted](https://twitter.com/TNDeptofHealth/status/1342952651022086147) that the data reported on December 26, 2020, included two days of data, and that the number of deaths reported were “limited” due to the holiday.
On December 19, 2020, Tennessee announced that due to the volume of tests being processed they will likely release a combined report with data from both December 19, 2020 and December 20, 2020 on December 20, 2020. As a result, we were unable to update their data on December 20, 2020.

On December 12, 2020, Tennessee [announced](https://twitter.com/tndeptofhealth/status/1337869853621964805?s=21) via the official Tennessee Department of Heath twitter that the data for December 12, 2020 is incomplete and does not include all negative test results. Please exercise caution when looking at data from this time period and be aware that 7 day averages may be a more reliable metric than individual figures at this moment.

As of July 3, 2020, **Now hospitalized** data includes both positive and pending cases. We have updated hospitalizations for March 31–July 3 to include both positive and pending cases as well.

As of June 10, 2020, **Total cases** include both confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 reported to or tested by the Tennessee Department of Health. 

On April 5, 2020, Tennessee reported a decline in **Recoveries**.
