NE,"Nebraska combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard, and thus antigen tests are included in our ""Total Tests (PCR)"" metric.

On November 13, 2020, Nebraska removed cumulative hospitalized count dropped by 21 without explanation.

On November 6, 2020, Nebraska removed 114 recoveries without explanation.

As of October 30, 2020, our **Total tests** metrics include Nevada's **Total tests (in specimens)**.

On October 30, 2020, we backfilled the full time series for Nebraska's Total Tests into our ""Total Tests (PCR)"" metric from a Nebraska GIS query. At the same time, we filled our Positive Tests (PCR) and Negative Tests (PCR) from the same query.

On September 20, 2020, Nebraska started publishing **Total Tests (in specimens)** in addition to **People Tested (in people)**, and we started collecting the Total Tests daily into our Total Tests (PCR) metric.
