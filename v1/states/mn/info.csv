MN,"On September 17, 2020, we switched Minnesota's specimens timeseries to **Total Test Encounters (PCR)** based on correspondence with the state, which revealed that their ""total approximate number of completed tests"" reflects individuals tested per day.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.

As of September 18, 2020, Minnesota total test results are drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. 
The number of unique people tested is available in our API as `totalTestsPeopleViral`.

From September 27 to October 4, 2020, Minnesota did not report the current number of hospitalizations or patients in the ICU. We froze these values through October 2, 2020. On October 3, 2020, we removed the values in accordance with our policy of not carrying over current values for longer than 7 days. The values were restored on October 4, 2020.",https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/situation.html,https://mn.gov/covid19/data/response-prep/response-capacity.jsp,,,,@mnhealth,https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/index.html,Encounters,totalTestEncountersViral,Total Test Encounters (PCR),All data,false,Minnesota,27
