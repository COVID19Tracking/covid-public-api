MN,"On September 17, 2020, we switched Minnesota's specimens timeseries to **Total Test Encounters (PCR)** based on correspondence with the state, which revealed that their ""total approximate number of completed tests"" reflects individuals tested per day.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.

As of September 18, 2020, Minnesota total test results are drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. 
The number of unique people tested is available in our API as `totalTestsPeopleViral`.",https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/situation.html,https://mn.gov/covid19/data/response-prep/response-capacity.jsp,,,,@mnhealth,https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/index.html,Encounters,totalTestEncountersViral,Total Test Encounters (PCR),All data,false,Minnesota,27
