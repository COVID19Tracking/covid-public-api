MN,"As of June 5, 2020, Minnesota began reporting **total tests** in specimens, but on July 30, 2020, Minnesota returned to reporting total tests in people tested. Due to this change, the number of total tests reported in our `totalTestResults` API field for Minnesota—which currently uses the people-tested number for many states and territories—decreased by approximately 200,000 tests. 

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.",https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/situation.html,,,@mnhealth,https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/index.html,Specimens,totalTestsViral,Minnesota,27,,false
