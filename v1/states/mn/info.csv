MN,"Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.

On November 28, 2020 Minnesota announced on their COVID-19 page that the data reported on November 28, 2020, would include data for both November 26, 2020, and November 27, 2020 due to the fact that they did not update their data on November 26, 2020 because of the Thanksgiving holiday. As a result, figures reported on November 28, 2020 include data reported during the previous 48 hour period, as opposed to the previous 24 hours.

On November 26, 2020, Minnesota announced on their [COVID-19 page](https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/situation.html) that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020 due to the Thanksgiving holiday. Because Minnesota’s data is “current as of 4 p.m. the previous day”, this change in their reporting schedule results in the data reported for November 27, 2020 being the data that would normally have been reported on November 26, 2020.

From September 27 to October 4, 2020, Minnesota did not report the current number of hospitalizations or patients in the ICU. We froze these values through October 2, 2020. On October 3, 2020, we removed the values in accordance with our policy of not carrying over current values for longer than 7 days. The values were restored on October 4, 2020.

As of September 18, 2020, Minnesota total test results are drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. 
The number of unique people tested is available in our API as `totalTestsPeopleViral`.

On September 17, 2020, we switched Minnesota's specimens timeseries to **Total Test Encounters (PCR)** based on correspondence with the state, which revealed that their ""total approximate number of completed tests"" reflects individuals tested per day.",https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/situation.html,https://mn.gov/covid19/data/response-prep/response-capacity.jsp,,,,@mnhealth,https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/index.html,Encounters,totalTestEncountersViral,Total Test Encounters (PCR),All data,false,Minnesota,27
