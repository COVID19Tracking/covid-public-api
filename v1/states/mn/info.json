Due to this change, the number of total tests reported in our `totalTestResults` API field for Minnesota—which currently uses the people-tested number for many states and territories—decreased by approximately 200,000 tests. \n\nOn September 17, 2020, we switched Minnesota's specimens timeseries to **Total Test Encounters (PCR)** based on correspondence with the state, which revealed that their \"total approximate number of completed tests\" reflects individuals tested per day.\n\nNegative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.","covid19Site":"https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/situation.html","covid19SiteSecondary":"","covid19SiteTertiary":"","twitter":"@mnhealth","covid19SiteOld":"https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/index.html","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Encounters","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"totalTestEncountersViral","name":"Minnesota","fips":"27","pui":"","pum":false}
