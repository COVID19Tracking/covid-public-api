{"state":"MS","notes":"As of May 23, 2020, Mississippi is separating out PCR and antibody tests. We now report both separately. \n\nOn May 26, 2020, news reports indicated that 95 antibody tests had returned positive in Mississippi, but we have not found more recent data since then for this metric.\n\nBetween June 17 and June 22, 2020, Mississippi experienced technical difficulties with their reporting system. We filled in five days of **case** and **death** data on June 22, 2020.\n\nOn September 11, 2020, we discovered a new source for Mississippi current hospitalizations and current ICU admissions on the Mississippi State Department of Health website.\n\nOn September 15, 2020, Mississippi resumed reporting current hospitalizations, ICU, and ventilations on the source we have historically used for this metric. We are working to backfill these data points in our historical data.\n\nNegative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.","covid19Site":"https://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/14,0,420.html","covid19SiteSecondary":null,"covid19SiteTertiary":null,"covid19SiteQuaternary":null,"covid19SiteQuinary":null,"twitter":"@msdh","covid19SiteOld":"https://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/14,0,420.html","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Specimens","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"posNeg","totalTestResultsField":"posNeg","pui":"Only positives","pum":false,"name":"Mississippi","fips":"28"}
