MS,"As of May 23, 2020, Mississippi is separating out PCR and antibody tests. We now report both separately.

Between June 17 and June 22, 2020, Mississippi experienced technical difficulties with their reporting system. We filled in five days of **case** and **death** data on June 22, 2020.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.","https://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/14,0,420.html",,,@msdh,"https://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/14,0,420.html",,,Only positives,false,Mississippi,28
