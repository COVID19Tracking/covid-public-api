NY,"Due to an exclusion of **probable COVID-19 deaths** in the state's data, New York City and New York State report substantially diverging death counts. As of June 1, 2020, New York City reported 5740 more deaths than New York State. We use the data from the state, so our dataset excludes these probable COVID-19 deaths. 

New York State has not reported new **Ever hospitalized** data since June 2, 2020.

The **Recovered** data point we report for New York reflects the number of lab-confirmed COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.",https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/county-county-breakdown-positive-cases,https://covid19tracker.health.ny.gov/views/NYS-COVID19-Tracker/NYSDOHCOVID-19Tracker-Fatalities?%3Aembed=yes&%3Atoolbar=no&%3Atabs=n,https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-updates-new-yorkers-states-progress-during-covid-19-pandemic-47,,,@healthnygov,https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/coronavirus/,Encounters,posNeg,posNeg,Only positives,false,New York,36
