NY,"New York City reports **Deaths (probable)** from COVID-19 that New York State does not include in its data reporting. Because we collect state data, not city or county data, these New York City probable deaths from COVID-19 are not included in our dataset. The total number of deaths from COVID-19 for New York State reported by the CDC is significantly larger than the total number of deaths from COVID-19 reported by New York State. 

The **Recovered** data point we report for New York reflects the number of lab-confirmed COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.

New York State has not reported new **Ever hospitalized** data since June 2, 2020.

As of November 23, 2020, New York's `totalTestResults` are drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.
