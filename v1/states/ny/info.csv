NY,"Due to an exclusion of **probable COVID-19 deaths** in the state's data, New York City and New York State report substantially diverging death counts. As of June 1, 2020, New York City reported 5740 more deaths than New York State. We use the data from the state, so our dataset excludes these probable COVID-19 deaths.
