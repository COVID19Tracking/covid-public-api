NY,"New York State has not reported new **Ever hospitalized** data since June 2, 2020.

The **Recovered** data point we report for New York reflects the number of lab-confirmed COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.

As of June 1, 2020, New York City reported 5740 more deaths (probable and confirmed) than New York State reports for NYC. Due to an exclusion of **probable COVID-19 deaths** in the state's data, New York City and New York State report substantially diverging death counts. We use the data from the state, so our dataset excludes these probable COVID-19 deaths.
