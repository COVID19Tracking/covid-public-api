{"state":"VT","notes":"Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive** from **Total PCR tests (people)**. \n\nOn December 2, 2020, Vermont added approximately 120 cases to its case count, representing probable cases since the beginning of September in the state (previously, the state had only reported PCR-confirmed cases). It provided a timeseries, so we backfilled our Positive field to avoid the impression of an additional 120 case rise on December 2. However, our Negative (people or cases) number for the state was computed by subtracting confirmed cases from total people tested. We kept this calculation up to December 1, since it is more accurate than subtracting probable cases (which are not identified via PCR testing). Starting December 2, in the absence of better data, we compute Negative using Positive - Cases (confirmed + probable) instead. This means that negatives registered an artificial 120 drop on December 2, though its impact will be concealed by the volume of negative testing.\n\nOn November 26, 2020, Vermont announced on their [COVID-19 page](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19) that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020.\n\nOn **November 3, 2020**, Vermont’s **Total PCR tests (people)** decreased without explanation. As a result, Vermont’s negative test results, which are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (people)** decreased as well.\n\nOn October 29, 2020, Vermont started publishing **Total PCR Tests (in specimens)** in addition to **Total PCR Tests (in people)**. We backfilled the full time series for this metric from Vermont's Arcgis layer.\n\nAs of October 29, 2020, Vermont's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. \n\nOn September 23, 2020, Vermont's **total tests** decreased by about 80 tests with no explanation. \n\nOn August 19, 2020, Vermont's **total tests** decreased by about 200 tests with no explanation.  \n\nBetween May 15 and May 16, 2020, Vermont's **total tests** decreased by about 1,000 tests with no explanation.","covid19Site":"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/85f43bd849e743cb957993a545d17170","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/current-activity-vermont#dashboard","covid19SiteTertiary":null,"covid19SiteQuaternary":null,"covid19SiteQuinary":null,"twitter":"@healthvermont","covid19SiteOld":"https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/infectious-disease/2019-novel-coronavirus","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Specimens","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"totalTestsViral","totalTestResultsField":"Total Tests (PCR)","pui":"Positives + Negatives","pum":false,"name":"Vermont","fips":"50"}
