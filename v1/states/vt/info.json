{"state":"VT","notes":"Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive** from **Total PCR tests (people)**. \n\nOn December 4, 2020, Vermont provided a timeseries for both confirmed and probable cases. We backfilled **Positive**, **Positive Cases (PCR)** and **Probable Cases** and updated **Total PCR Tests (in People)** and **Negative** to match the new confirmed series.\n\nOn December 2, 2020, Vermont added approximately 120 cases to its case count, representing probable cases since the beginning of September in the state (previously, the state had only reported PCR-confirmed cases). It provided a timeseries, and we backfilled our Positive field to avoid the impression of an additional 120 case rise on December 2.\n\nOn November 26, 2020, Vermont announced on their [COVID-19 page](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19) that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020.\n\nOn **November 3, 2020**, Vermont’s **Total PCR tests (people)** decreased without explanation. As a result, Vermont’s negative test results, which are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (people)** decreased as well.\n\nOn October 29, 2020, Vermont started publishing **Total PCR Tests (in specimens)** in addition to **Total PCR Tests (in people)**.
