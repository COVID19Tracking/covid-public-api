WA,"Washington’s data is on a 1 day lag in our timeseries due to consistently updating after 7:30 pm Eastern Time, when we publish our daily update.

Washington State reports **confirmed cases**, **laboratory tests**, and **deaths** as of the previous day. 

We report the most recent hospitalization data available for Washington. In some cases, this data may be reviewed and revised by the Washington State Department of Health. As a result, Washington considers hospitalization data complete after a 18-day lag period. In our data this lag is 20 days.

On December 5, 2020, Washington announced that up to 90 of the deaths reported “yesterday” were incorrectly classified and were not due to COVID-19. Because we capture Washington’s data on a one day lag due to late update times, this will affect our data for December 5, 2020.

On December 4, 2020 Washington resumed updating **Total PCR tests (test encounters)**. Because Washington’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, this update will be shown on our data for December 5, 2020. As a result, we are again able to update **Negative PCR tests (people)** which is again a calculated value, from the subtraction of **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (test encounters)**. They further noted that data from November 21, 2020 through December 5, 2020 is incomplete.

On November 25, 2020, Washington began publishing Currently in ICU and Currently hospitalized on the official [Washington Department of Health COVID-19 - risk assessment dashboard](https://coronavirus.wa.gov/what-you-need-know/covid-19-risk-assessment-dashboard). As of December 4, 2020, we are capturing Washington’s Currently hospitalized and Currently in ICU from this source, and have applied this change retroactively going back to May 13, 2020 for Currently hospitalized, and September 19, 2020 for Currently in ICU.

On November 28, 2020, Washington announced that due to high laboratory report volumes, they have not been able to complete their deduplication processes for some cases. As a result, they have reported some duplicate cases in their daily data dashboard update. Please exercise caution when using numbers from November 14, 2020 through December 5, 2020, as they likely include duplicate cases.

On November 26, 2020, Washington announced on their [COVID-19 Data Dashboard](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/DataDashboard) that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020. Because Washington’s data is on a one day lag in our time series due to late update times, we will be unable to update Washington’s data on November 27, 2020.

On November 24, 2020, Washington announced that the Department of Health will not be reporting new negative test results until November 30, 2020, and then temporally removed the **Total tests (in test encounters)** metric from the dashboard. As a result all testing numbers will be frozen until the state returns to updating them. 

As of September 18, 2020, Washington's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

On August 26, 2020, Washington switched its total tests units to testing encounters, excluding future encounters from individuals who test positive. It also provided a full timeseries of the figure. This testing encounters figure is slightly different from how we define testing encounters in two ways: first, our definition of testing encounters includes encounters after a positive test, and second, it should be calculated not by summing resulted tests but by counting all daily tests in a separate reporting stream. Despite these differences, the historical and current values of Washington’s figure are still stored in our **Total PCR tests (test encounters)** field.

On August 2, 2020, Washington state Department of Health reported that ""DOH is continuing to experience issues with its reporting system today. We are able to report cases, deaths and hospitalizations but have not reported new negative test results since 8/1.""

On July 14, 2020, Washington state revised its count of COVID-19 **deaths** downward by 39, because it determined that even though those 39 people had tested positive for COVID-19, COVID-19 was not a contributing cause in their deaths.

On June 22, 2020, we updated previous values for **cases** and **total tests** in our time-series using data from Washington state's dashboard. This update caused an artificial decrease in cases and tests between June 21 and June 22.

On June 18, 2020, Washington revised its **Total PCR tests (people)** downward. On the same date, Washington decreased its count of COVID-19 **deaths by 7**, because it determined that even though those 7 people had tested positive for COVID-19, COVID-19 was not a contributing cause in their deaths.

On April 18, 2020, Washington state removed 190 **confirmed cases** that were discovered to be out-of-state residents tested in Washington laboratories. 

Between March 31 and April 15, 2020, Washington state did not report **Negative PCR tests (people)**.
