CA,"Before April 1 CA was inconsistent in the timing of reporting so we used faster-updating sources, we then standardized on the state data dashboard(s). This led to a drop in cases and deaths, as the state's data lags county sources.
The state reported a huge batch of negative tests on April 4 and again on April 22.
As of April 22, California now reports specimens tested instead of people tested. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested.
On July 8, CA data included a backlog of data from Los Angeles County, which had not reported for several days. About 1000 of the 11,000 new cases are due to this spike in reporting.",https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx,https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/New-Release-2020.aspx,,@CAPublicHealth,https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx,California,06,,false
