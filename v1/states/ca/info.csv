CA,"Before April 1, California was inconsistent in the timing of reporting so we used faster-updating county sources, we then standardized on the state data dashboard(s). This led to a drop in cases and deaths, as the state's data lags county sources.

The state reported a huge batch of negative tests on April 4 and again on April 22.

As of April 22, California now reports specimens tested instead of people tested. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested.

On July 8, California data included a backlog of data from Los Angeles County, which had not reported for several days. About 1000 of the 11,000 new cases are due to this spike in reporting.

From June 29 to July 5, California made a few revisions to daily case numbers, on July 17 we updated the values based on the most recent data from their dashboard.

Starting July 23, California has reported that its current hospitalization and ICU numbers are incomplete due to its transition to the HHS reporting system. We carried over hospitalization figures until July 28. We will backfill the complete numbers for July 23 - July 28 when reporting is back at 100%",https://update.covid19.ca.gov,https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19CasesDashboard_15931020425010/Cases?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no,https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19HospitalsDashboard/Hospitals?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no,@CAPublicHealth,https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx,California,06,,false
