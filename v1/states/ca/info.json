{"state":"CA","name":"California","fips":"06","notes":"California has been inconsistent in its timing of reporting. We used faster-updating sources until 4/1, when we standardized on its [new data dashboards](https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19PublicDashboard/Covid-19Public?:embed=y&:display_count=no&:showVizHome=no). This led to a drop in cases and deaths, as the state's data lags county sources. The state reported a huge batch of negative tests on April 4 and again on April 22. As of April 22, California now reports specimens tested instead of people tested. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested.","covid19Site":"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/New-Release-2020.aspx","covid19SiteOld":"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx","twitter":"@CAPublicHealth","pui":"Only positives","pum":null}
