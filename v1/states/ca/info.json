{"state":"CA","notes":"Prior to April 1, 2020, we used county data sources for more reliably timely reporting of California's COVID-19 data. At the start of April, we began reporting primarily from the state data dashboard(s). This led to a modest drop in **cases** and **deaths**, as the state's data lags behind the county sources.\n\nOn April 4 and April 22, 2020, California reported large batches of backlogged **negative test** data. \n\nAs of April 22, 2020, California has reported specimens tested instead of people tested. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested.\n\nOn July 8, 2020, California data included a backlog from Los Angeles County, which had not reported for several days. Approximately 1,000 of the 11,000 new cases were attributed to this backlog data.\n\nFrom June 29 to July 5, 2020, California made revisions to daily **case** numbers. On July 17, we updated the values based on the most recent data from the state dashboard.\n\nFrom July 23 through July 28, 2020, California reported that its **Now hospitalized** and **Now in ICU** were incomplete due to its transition to the HHS reporting system. We carried over hospitalization figures until July 28. We will backfill the complete numbers for this period if the complete data becomes available.\n\nNegative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.\n","covid19Site":"https://update.covid19.ca.gov","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19CasesDashboard_15931020425010/Cases?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19HospitalsDashboard/Hospitals?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no","twitter":"@CAPublicHealth","covid19SiteOld":"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":null,"covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":null,"pui":"Only positives","pum":false,"name":"California","fips":"06"}
