{"state":"CA","notes":"Before April 1 CA was inconsistent in the timing of reporting so we used faster-updating sources, we then standardized on the state data dashboard(s). This led to a drop in cases and deaths, as the state's data lags county sources.\nThe state reported a huge batch of negative tests on April 4 and again on April 22.\nAs of April 22, California now reports specimens tested instead of people tested. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested.","covid19Site":"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/New-Release-2020.aspx","covid19SiteTertiary":"","twitter":"@CAPublicHealth","covid19SiteOld":"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx","name":"California","fips":"06","pui":"","pum":false}
