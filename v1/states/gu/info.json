{"state":"GU","notes":"As of November 21, 2020, Guam’s Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting Positive PCR tests (people) from Total PCR tests (specimens) in the absence of better data.\n\nGuam's counts include 11 people tested at the San Diego naval base.\n\nAs of December 7, 2020, Guam’s Total PCR tests (specimens), Total antigen tests (specimens), Total antibody tests (specimens) will include all specimens reported. Previously they did not include follow up testing for known cases.\n\nOn November 21, 2020, we cleared Guam’s Total PCR tests (People) timeseries. Prior to November 21, we had believed that Guam’s negative counts represented people. However after outreach to Guam’s health department, we learned that the negatives represented specimens (while its positives represent cases). This change means Guam’s totalTestResults represent specimens excluding repeat positive results.\n\nOn November 18, 2020, Guam [announced](https://ghs.guam.gov/jic-release-no-454-results-112-test-positive-covid-19-two-gdoe-employees-test-positive-covid-19) that “Beginning next week, the Department of Public Health and Social Services (DPHSS) will shift from daily situation reports to weekly reports in order to provide for more comprehensive data analysis. To reflect this, the Joint Information Center (JIC) will report profiles of confirmed cases on a weekly basis only.” As a result, Positive antigen tests (specimens) and Positive antibody tests (specimens) will only be updated once weekly going forward.\n\nOn September 3, 2020, Guam reported that it had shifted to using the more restrictive August 5 definition of probable cases released by the CSTE. From March 12, 2020 to September 2, 2020 Guam reported eight probable cases under the previous probable case definition. Due to the change, Guam has no cases that classify as probable cases as of September 3, 2020, and 8 cases have been removed from Guams's total case count.","covid19Site":"http://dphss.guam.gov/covid-19/","covid19SiteSecondary":null,"covid19SiteTertiary":null,"covid19SiteQuaternary":null,"covid19SiteQuinary":null,"twitter":"@guamdphss","covid19SiteOld":"https://ghs.guam.gov/coronavirus-covid-19","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Specimens","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"posNeg","totalTestResultsField":"posNeg","pui":"All Data","pum":false,"name":"Guam","fips":"66"}
