GU,"Testing data from Guam's Situation Report is often older than case data in Guam's press releases, so there are sometimes more cases than test results. On May 4, Guam adjusted cases down from 150 to 149 because they found that the case was double counted, number of recovered was also adjusted down because 7 people were returned to isolation.
Guam's counts include 11 people tested at the San Diego naval base.
As of May 25, Guam is reporting people tested.",http://dphss.guam.gov/covid-19/,https://ghs.guam.gov/coronavirus-covid-20,,@guamdphss,https://ghs.guam.gov/coronavirus-covid-19,Guam,66,,false
