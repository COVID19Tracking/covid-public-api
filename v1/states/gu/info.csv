GU,"Guam's counts include 11 people tested at the San Diego naval base.

On November 18, 2020, Guam [announced](https://ghs.guam.gov/jic-release-no-454-results-112-test-positive-covid-19-two-gdoe-employees-test-positive-covid-19) that “Beginning next week, the Department of Public Health and Social Services (DPHSS) will shift from daily situation reports to weekly reports in order to provide for more comprehensive data analysis. To reflect this, the Joint Information Center (JIC) will report profiles of confirmed cases on a weekly basis only.” As a result, Antigen and Antibody, and PCR (specimen) testing data will only be updated once weekly going forwards.

On September 3, 2020, Guam reported that it had shifted to using the more restrictive August 5 definition of probable cases released by the CSTE. From March 12, 2020 to September 2, 2020 Guam reported eight probable cases under the previous probable case definition. Due to the change, Guam has no cases that classify as probable cases as of September 3, 2020, and 8 cases have been removed from Guams's total case count.",http://dphss.guam.gov/covid-19/,,,,,@guamdphss,https://ghs.guam.gov/coronavirus-covid-19,Specimens,posNeg,posNeg,All Data,false,Guam,66
