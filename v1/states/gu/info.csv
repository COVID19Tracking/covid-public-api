GU,"Guam's counts include 11 people tested at the San Diego naval base.

On September 3, 2020, Guam reported that it had shifted to using the more restrictive August 5 definition of probable cases released by the CSTE. From March 12, 2020 to September 2, 2020 Guam reported eight probable cases under the previous probable case definition. On September 3, Guam adopted the new CDC case definition for probable cases.
