MO,"As of May 22, 2020, Missouri reports PCR tests separately from antibody tests. 

On September 5, 2020, the Missouri DHSS [added an additional 72 deaths](http://twitter.com/HealthyLivingMo/status/1302314149620391937?s=20) to their total count, ""most of which occurred June-August"".

As of October 7, 2020, Missouri's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as `totalTestsPeopleViral`.

On October 8, 2020, Missouri added current hospitalizations to their COVID-19 dashboard, and we began to capture this metric. Historical data is also available and we are working on backfilling our data for days where this metric was unavailable.

On October 11, 2020, [Missouri announced that a database error had resulted in an “incorrect inflation” of cases in its October 10, 2020 report](https://www.kshb.com/news/coronavirus/missouri-covid-19-database-error-causes-incorrect-inflation-of-cases). When The COVID Tracking Project is able to obtain correct official data for October 10 from Missouri, we will update our dataset to reflect the correction.

On October 14, 2020, Missouri testing numbers by people decreased. This resulted in a decrease in all total testing numbers (people) and negative cases. Testing numbers by specimen are unaffected.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.",https://showmestrong.mo.gov/data/public-health/,https://showmestrong.mo.gov/public-healthcare-testing/,https://showmestrong.mo.gov/public-healthcare/,,,@HealthyLivingMo,https://health.mo.gov/living/healthcondiseases/communicable/novel-coronavirus/,Specimens,totalTestsViral,Total Tests (PCR),Only positives,false,Missouri,29
