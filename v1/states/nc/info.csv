NC,"On July 22, 2020, North Carolina started reporting the number of patients **currently in the ICU**.

On August 12, 2020, North Carolina [announced](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/ncdhhs-corrects-covid-19-testing-totals-after-identifying-labcorp-reporting) a major correction in its **Total PCR tests (specimens)**, resulting in a decrease of more than 220,000 reported tests.

On September 26, 2020, North Carolina started reporting deaths among individuals who had tested positive via antigen. We record this figure in our **Deaths (probable)** field.

The metric reported in our API as `totalTestsAntigen` only includes tests reported after September, 22, 2020. If previous values become available from North Carolina we will backfill the complete time series.
