{"state":"AK","notes":"Alaska combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard.\n\nNegative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.\n\nOn November 17, 2020, Alaska [announced](https://coronavirus-response-alaska-dhss.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/cases-frequently-asked-questions) that “As of 11/17/2020, the cases dashboard will not be showing data on recovered and active cases due to the increasing State case load”. As a result, Alaska’s Recovered will no longer be updated.\n\nOn November 16, 2020 we updated the **Positive** field to include only residents. We also deleted the time series for **Positive Cases (PCR)** because Alaska is lumping PCR and antigen testing for their case definition.\n\nOn November 16, 2020 we added **Cumulative Hospitalized** (which includes both residents and non-residents), although the value does not reflect current hospitalizations.\n\nOn November 7, 2020, Alaska announced that their testing dashboard would be \"temporarily disabled from November 6th to November 9th\" and that testing data could be accessed through their [data summary tables](https://coronavirus-response-alaska-dhss.hub.arcgis.com). After originally using the data summary tables on November 7, we have reversed that decision, and reverted the values to their November 6th state. The frozen values were replaced on November 10, with values from the state's [Tests Dataset](https://coronavirus-response-alaska-dhss.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/tests-dataset). \n\nOn November 6, 2020, Alaska’s Total PCR tests (specimens) and Positive PCR tests (specimens) decreased without explanation. As a result, Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated by subtracting Positive PCR tests (people) from Total PCR tests (specimens), decreased as well.\n\nOn November 5, 2020, Alaska’s Total PCR tests (specimens) increased from roughly 628k to 782k. We were unable to find an explanation for the increase.\n\nAs of September 18, 2020, Alaska's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.\n\n","covid19Site":"http://dhss.alaska.gov/dph/Epi/id/Pages/COVID-19/monitoring.aspx","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/ed1c874ca60b4c15ab09095a070065ca","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://alaska-dhss.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/8782a14ef52342e99f866a3b8a3e624a","covid19SiteQuaternary":"https://services1.arcgis.com/WzFsmainVTuD5KML/arcgis/rest/services/Tests_Dataset/FeatureServer/0/query?where=Test_Result+%3D+%27Negative%27&outStatistics=%5B%7B%27statisticType%27%3A+%27count%27%2C+%27onStatisticField%27%3A+%27FID%27%2C+%27outStatisticFieldName%27%3A+%27tests_negative%27%7D%5D","covid19SiteQuinary":"https://services1.arcgis.com/WzFsmainVTuD5KML/arcgis/rest/services/Tests_Dataset/FeatureServer/0/query?where=Test_Result+%3D+%27Positive%27&outStatistics=%5B%7B%27statisticType%27%3A+%27count%27%2C+%27onStatisticField%27%3A+%27FID%27%2C+%27outStatisticFieldName%27%3A+%27tests_positive%27%7D%5D","twitter":"@Alaska_DHSS","covid19SiteOld":"http://dhss.alaska.gov/dph/Epi/id/Pages/COVID-19/default.aspx","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Specimens","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"totalTestsViral","totalTestResultsField":"Total Tests (PCR)","pui":"All data","pum":false,"name":"Alaska","fips":"02"}
