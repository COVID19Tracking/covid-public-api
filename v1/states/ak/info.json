{"state":"AK","notes":"Alaska combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard.\n\nAlaska reports a \"Total count\" of people who have been hospitalized, but we do not record that count in our **Ever hospitalized** metric, since it does not include people who are currently in the hospital.\n\nNegative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.\n\nOn November 6, 2020, Alaska’s Total PCR tests (specimens) and Positive PCR tests (specimens) decreased without explanation. As a result, Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated by subtracting Positive PCR tests (people) from Total PCR tests (specimens), decreased as well.\n\nOn November 5, 2020, Alaska’s Total PCR tests (specimens) increased from roughly 628k to 782k. We were unable to find an explanation for the increase.\n\nAs of September 18, 2020, Alaska's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.\n\nAs of July 16, 2020, we are reporting non-resident cases as part of **Cases or Positive PCR tests (people)** for Alaska.","covid19Site":"http://dhss.alaska.gov/dph/Epi/id/Pages/COVID-19/monitoring.aspx","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/ed1c874ca60b4c15ab09095a070065ca","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://alaska-dhss.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/8782a14ef52342e99f866a3b8a3e624a","covid19SiteQuaternary":null,"covid19SiteQuinary":null,"twitter":"@Alaska_DHSS","covid19SiteOld":"http://dhss.alaska.gov/dph/Epi/id/Pages/COVID-19/default.aspx","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Specimens","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"totalTestsViral","totalTestResultsField":"Total Tests (PCR)","pui":"All data","pum":false,"name":"Alaska","fips":"02"}
