AK,"Alaska combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard.

Alaska reports a ""Total count"" of people who have been hospitalized, but we do not record that count in our **Ever hospitalized** metric, since it does not include people who are currently in the hospital.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.

On November 7, 2020, Alaska announced that their testing dashboard would be ""temporarily disabled from November 6th to November 9th"" and that testing data could be accessed through their [data summary tables] (https://coronavirus-response-alaska-dhss.hub.arcgis.com). After originally using the data summary tables on November 7th, we have reversed that decision, reverted the values to their November 6th state, and will wait until November 9th to update testing data for Alaska, since the values in the data summary tables are significantly less than those previously reported by the dashboard.

On November 6, 2020, Alaska’s Total PCR tests (specimens) and Positive PCR tests (specimens) decreased without explanation. As a result, Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated by subtracting Positive PCR tests (people) from Total PCR tests (specimens), decreased as well.

On November 5, 2020, Alaska’s Total PCR tests (specimens) increased from roughly 628k to 782k. We were unable to find an explanation for the increase.

As of September 18, 2020, Alaska's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

As of July 16, 2020, we are reporting non-resident cases as part of **Cases or Positive PCR tests (people)** for Alaska.",http://dhss.alaska.gov/dph/Epi/id/Pages/COVID-19/monitoring.aspx,https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/ed1c874ca60b4c15ab09095a070065ca,https://alaska-dhss.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/8782a14ef52342e99f866a3b8a3e624a,,,@Alaska_DHSS,http://dhss.alaska.gov/dph/Epi/id/Pages/COVID-19/default.aspx,Specimens,totalTestsViral,Total Tests (PCR),All data,false,Alaska,02
