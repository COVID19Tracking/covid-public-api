AK,"Alaska combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard.

Alaska reports a ""Total count"" of people who have been hospitalized, but we do not record that count in our **Ever hospitalized** metric, since it does not include people who are currently in the hospital.

As of July 16, 2020, we are reporting non-resident cases as part of **Cases or Positive PCR tests (people)** for Alaska.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.",http://dhss.alaska.gov/dph/Epi/id/Pages/COVID-19/monitoring.aspx,https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/ed1c874ca60b4c15ab09095a070065ca,https://alaska-dhss.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/8782a14ef52342e99f866a3b8a3e624a,@Alaska_DHSS,http://dhss.alaska.gov/dph/Epi/id/Pages/COVID-19/default.aspx,Specimens,totalTestsViral,All data,false,Alaska,02
