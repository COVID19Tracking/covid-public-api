MP,"The Northern Mariana Islands have not posted a new **Recovered** number since July 15, 2020. 

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.

The Northern Mariana Islands Total PCR tests (specimens) values decrease occasionally without explanation. We suspect this is due to some sort of data quality assurance or de-deduplication.

The Northern Mariana Islands provides irregular data updates, so changes in values often represent multiple days of data.

On July 23, 2020, we switched our **Total tests** units to the people-tested metric reported by the Northern Mariana Islands, which led to a drop in total tests. We will backfill total tests data for the territory as soon as we are able to do so.",https://cnmichcc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/4061b674fc964efe84f7774b7979d2b5,https://services8.arcgis.com/zkkZCub5I6ydvXQj/ArcGIS/rest/services/Coronavirus_PublicDashboardView/FeatureServer/3/query?where=1%3D1&outStatistics=%5B%7B%27statisticType%27%3A+%27max%27%2C+%27onStatisticField%27%3A+%27reportdt%27%7D%2C+%7B%27statisticType%27%3A+%27sum%27%2C+%27onStatisticField%27%3A+%27confirmedcases%27%7D%2C+%7B%27statisticType%27%3A+%27sum%27%2C+%27onStatisticField%27%3A+%27totalspeccnmi%27%7D%2C+%7B%27statisticType%27%3A+%27sum%27%2C+%27onStatisticField%27%3A+%27deaths%27%7D%2C+%7B%27statisticType%27%3A+%27sum%27%2C+%27onStatisticField%27%3A+%27recovered%27%7D%2C+%7B%27statisticType%27%3A+%27sum%27%2C+%27onStatisticField%27%3A+%27hospitalized%27%7D%5D,https://cnmichcc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/4061b674fc964efe84f7774b7979d2b5,https://cnmichcc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/4061b674fc964efe84f7774b7979d2b5,,@cnmichcc,https://www.chcc.gov.mp/coronavirusinformation.php,People,posNeg,posNeg,No Data,false,Northern Mariana Islands,69
