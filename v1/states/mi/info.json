{"state":"MI","notes":"Michigan has reported each day's negative results since March 10 but has never totaled them. We sum all the negative results and report the total. Michigan reports specimens tested instead of people tested. \nRecovered counts are updated once a week. \n\nAs of May 16, Michigan uses 'total specimens' reported on lab testing page\n\nAs of May 23, Michigan is separating out antibody and PCR tests; we report the number of PCR tests. Total testing numbers might be impacted. \n\nAs of June 5, positives include both confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, as reported by the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services.\n\nOn June 11 Michigan DDHS provided an XLS with historical time series and we updated our dataÂ to reflect the correct dates of probable and confirmed cases and deaths. \n\nAs of July 7, Michigan updates its death figures three times a week after conducting reviews of death certificates. As a result, new deaths may not always reflect deaths in the past 24 hours.","covid19Site":"https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98163_98173---,00.html","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98159-523641--,00.html","covid19SiteTertiary":"","twitter":"@MichiganHHS","covid19SiteOld":"https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus","name":"Michigan","fips":"26","pui":"","pum":false}
