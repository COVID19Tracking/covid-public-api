{"state":"MI","notes":"On June 11, 2020, we updated our historical data from a spreadsheet provided by Michigan's Department of Health and Human Services in order to reflect the lab-reported dates of **probable and confirmed cases** and **probable and confirmed deaths** by date of death.\n\nAs of July 7, 2020, Michigan updates its death figures three times a week after conducting reviews of death certificates. As a result, \"new\" deaths may not always reflect deaths in the past 24 hours.\n\nMichigan updates its **Recovered** metric weekly and does not update any data on Sundays. Michigan combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard. Since March 10, 2020, Michigan has reported each day's Positive and Negative tests (people) by county but has never totaled these metrics for the state. We add new Positive and Negative tests (people) values daily to a running sum and report the total.
