MI,"Michigan updates its **Recovered** metric weekly and does not update any data on Sundays.

Our source for **Now hospitalized** and **Now in ICU** data in Michigan generally updates on Mondays and Fridays only. 

Michigan combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard. 

On November 24, 2020, Michigan announced via a [press release](https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98158-545993--,00.html) that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020 due to Thanksgiving holiday. On November 27, 2020, the state resumed data reporting where case counts would include cases since Wednesday, November 25th, 2020. The state estimated that the average number of cases across November 26th and November 27th, 2020 would be 8,581 cases per day.

On October 29, 2020, Michigan experienced connectivity issues resulting in some cases that would have been reported tomorrow to be reported today. This is due to the fact that the state has a strict 10AM cutoff for daily data reporting. This means the daily increase in cases encompasses more than one day's worth of data.

On October 15, 2020, Michigan announced that due to a laboratory result processing slowdown, several cases that would normally have been included in the October 14, 2020 update were reported on October 15, 2020. The issue has since been resolved. Aa a result, cases reported on October 15, 2020 may not have been reported within the last 24 hour period.

As of July 7, 2020, Michigan updates its death figures three times a week after conducting reviews of death certificates. As a result, ""new"" deaths may not always reflect deaths in the past 24 hours.

On June 11, 2020, we updated our historical data from a spreadsheet provided by Michigan's Department of Health and Human Services in order to reflect the lab-reported dates of **probable and confirmed cases** and **probable and confirmed deaths** by date of death.

Since March 10, 2020, Michigan has reported each day's Positive and Negative tests (people) by county but has never totaled these metrics for the state. We add new Positive and Negative tests (people) values daily to a running sum and report the total.
