{"state":"ND","notes":"On May 3, 2020, North Dakota began reporting two additional **death** metrics: deaths of people with lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 whose death records are still pending and deaths of people with lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 whose death certificates do not list COVID-19 as a cause of death. As of July 1, 2020, we have edited our historical figures to exclude these numbers from our death counts, resulting in an apparent drop from 24 deaths on May 2 to 16 on May 3. \n\nOn August 19, 2020, North Dakota launched a new dashboard with a number of new data points, including race and ethnicity data and ICU data. \n\nOn September 9, 2020, North Dakota began reporting “Susceptible Encounters” on its dashboard, which are defined as test encounters excluding those who have tested positive after the first time. We have begun recording the value in our **Total PCR tests (test encounters)** field.\n\nAs of September 11, 2020, North Dakota’s total test results reflect total test encounters. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as `totalTestsPeopleViral`.\n\nOn October 8, 2020, North Dakota released two figures describing those who are currently hospitalized. According to the [state dashboard annotation](https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases), the \"Hospitalized with COVID\" figure describes those whose main reason for hospitalization is COVID-19, and it also includes all those who are \"Hospitalized due to COVID\". We are using the \"Hospitalized with COVID\" figure for our Currently hospitalized field.","covid19Site":"https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases","covid19SiteSecondary":null,"covid19SiteTertiary":null,"covid19SiteQuaternary":null,"covid19SiteQuinary":null,"twitter":"@NDDOH","covid19SiteOld":"https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Encounters","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"totalTestEncountersViral","totalTestResultsField":"Total Test Encounters (PCR)","pui":"All data","pum":false,"name":"North Dakota","fips":"38"}
