{"state":"ND","notes":"On December 3, 2020, North Dakota stopped reporting patients Hospitalized with COVID on their [COVID-19 dashboard](https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases) to “eliminate the discrepancy” between patients Hospitalized with COVID and patients Hospitalized due to COVID. As of December 3, 2020, North Dakota’s Currently hospitalized will include only patients hospitalized due to COVID.\n\nOn December 1, 2020, we made changes to our historical deaths counts, changing our **Deaths (confirmed)** source from “Deaths Due to COVID-19” to “Total number of individuals who tested positive and died from any cause while infected with COVID-19.” We had originally switched to use “Deaths Due to COVID-19” on July 1, 2020, but because of growing backlogs of individuals with COVID-19 tests whose death certificates have not yet been filed were not being picked up in the figure, we switched back to best reflect the reality in the state. The change caused a 241 cumulative rise in North Dakota’s death figures.\n\nOn October 8, 2020, North Dakota released two figures describing those who are currently hospitalized. According to the [state dashboard annotation](https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases), the \"Hospitalized with COVID\" figure describes those whose main reason for hospitalization is COVID-19, and it also includes all those who are \"Hospitalized due to COVID\". We are using the \"Hospitalized with COVID\" figure for our **Currently hospitalized** and **Currently in ICU** metrics, however there are not matching Cumulative metrics so we are using the \"Due to COVID\" Cumulative hospitalized and ICU figures.\n\nOn November 12, 2020, North Dakota explained that higher than normal fluctuations may be seen in data from the week of November 9, 2020, due to a software issue which has been resolved.\n\nOn November 12, 2020, North Dakota [announced](https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases) that the high number of tests and positives was due in part to 5600 test backlog experienced by a third-party lab.\n\nOn November 11, 2020, North Dakota reported two days of data for all metrics except for Total PCR tests (specimens), Positive PCR tests (people), and Positive cases (confirmed + probable).\n\nOn November 10, 2020, North Dakota reported that their software for hospitalization metrics was down, an issue which also impacts active cases. We updated Total PCR tests (specimens), Positive PCR tests (people), and Positive cases (confirmed + probable) from their [daily news release](https://www.health.nd.gov/news/covid-19-test-results-0).\n\nAs of September 11, 2020, North Dakota’s total test results reflect total test encounters. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as `totalTestsPeopleViral`.\n\nOn September 9, 2020, North Dakota began reporting “Susceptible Encounters” on its dashboard, which are defined as test encounters excluding those who have tested positive after the first time. We have begun recording the value in our **Total PCR tests (test encounters)** field.\n\nOn August 19, 2020, North Dakota launched a new dashboard with a number of new data points, including race and ethnicity data and ICU data.
