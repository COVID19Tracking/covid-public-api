ND,"On May 3, 2020, North Dakota began reporting two additional **death** metrics: deaths of people with lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 whose death records are still pending and deaths of people with lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 whose death certificates do not list COVID-19 as a cause of death. As of July 1, 2020, we have edited our historical figures to exclude these numbers from our death counts, resulting in an apparent drop from 24 deaths on May 2 to 16 on May 3. 

On August 19, 2020, North Dakota launched a new dashboard with a number of new data points, including race and ethnicity data and ICU data. 

On September 9, 2020, North Dakota began reporting “Susceptible Encounters” on its dashboard, which are defined as test encounters excluding those who have tested positive after the first time. There is a possible typo in the definition on North Dakota’s dashboard making the number appear as if it is negative test encounters, but the value matches the total test encounters rather than the negative test encounters value in North Dakota’s raw data. We have reached out to confirm that it is a typo. We have begun recording the value in our **Total PCR tests (test encounters)** field.",https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases,,,@NDDOH,https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus,People,posNeg,North Dakota,38,,false
