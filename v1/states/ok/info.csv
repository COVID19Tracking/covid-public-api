OK,"On December 4, 2020 Oklahoma announced that the increase of 4,287 cases reported today was largely attributable to an issue with the state's reporting system, which resulted in the inclusion of backlogged cases from December 2 to December 4.

On November 25, 2020, Oklahoma announced via a [COVID-19 Situation update](https://coronavirus.health.ok.gov/articles/situation-update-covid-19-11252020) that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020 due to the Thanksgiving holiday. Because much of the data that we get for Oklahoma is sourced from their executive order reports, which are on a one day lag, we will only be able to partially update Oklahomaâ€™s data for November 26, 2020 and November 27, 2020 as a result.

On July 19 and July 20, Oklahoma noted that reported **Total cases** numbers were inaccurately low due to technical issues. 

Prior to April 10, 2020, Oklahoma reported ""Positive (Out-of-State)"" results. We excluded these figures from our data, as we assumed these individuals were isolated outside the state.",https://coronavirus.health.ok.gov/,https://coronavirus.health.ok.gov/sites/g/files/gmc786/f/eo_-_covid-19_report_-_12-3-20.pdf,https://coronavirus.health.ok.gov/sites/g/files/gmc786/f/2020.12.3_weekly_epi_report.pdf,,,@HealthyOklahoma,https://coronavirus.health.ok.gov,Specimens,posNeg,posNeg,All data,false,Oklahoma,40
