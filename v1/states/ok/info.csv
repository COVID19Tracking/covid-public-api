OK,"[Executive Order Reports](https://coronavirus.health.ok.gov/executive-order-reports)
first reported [comprehensive test results](https://coronavirus.health.ok.gov/articles/new-data-private-labs-show-tenfold-increase-covid-19-tests-administered-oklahoma-dating) on April 6. We exclude ""Positive (Out-of-State)"" results, as we assume these are isolated outside the state.
As of April 27, Oklahoma is reporting specimens tested. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested.
Due to differences in reporting, the number of negative tests might include inconclusive tests.
Oklahoma noted that reported case counts for July 19 and July 20 were inaccurately low due to technical issues. 
On July 21st, Oklahoma did not update the numbers of cases, positive tests, recoveries, or deaths.",https://coronavirus.health.ok.gov/,,,@HealthyOklahoma,https://coronavirus.health.ok.gov,Oklahoma,40,,false
