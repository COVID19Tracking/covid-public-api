Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested.\nDue to differences in reporting, the number of negative tests might include inconclusive tests.\nOklahoma noted that reported case counts for July 19 and July 20 were inaccurately low due to technical issues. \nOn July 21st, Oklahoma did not update the numbers of cases, positive tests, recoveries, or deaths.","covid19Site":"https://coronavirus.health.ok.gov/","covid19SiteSecondary":"","covid19SiteTertiary":"","twitter":"@HealthyOklahoma","covid19SiteOld":"https://coronavirus.health.ok.gov","name":"Oklahoma","fips":"40","pui":"","pum":false}
