AR,"On Aug 15, 2020, Arkansas data changed due to deduplication and the state's removal of out-of-state cases from its dataset. These changes resulted in reductions in **Total cases**, **Ever hospitalized**, and **Ever in ICU** data.

On September 3, 2020, Arkansas began reporting probable cases according to the most recent CSTE definitions, in addition to confirmed cases. This added 423 new cases to AR’s **Total cases** number that may have been from prior days.

On September 16, 2020, Arkansas’ **Negative Tests (PCR)** dropped by 26,801 tests, causing its **Total Tests (PCR)** to drop by 26,195 tests due to the reversal of a data dump of negative test results that Arkansas reversed. It also added 140 probable deaths, not all of which dated to September 16.

As of September 18, 2020, Arkansas' total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.",https://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/programs-services/topics/novel-coronavirus,https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/c2ef4a4fcbe5458fbf2e48a21e4fece9,https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/c2ef4a4fcbe5458fbf2e48a21e4fece9,@adhpio,https://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/programs-services/topics/novel-coronavirus,Specimens,totalTestsViral,Total Tests (PCR),All data,false,Arkansas,05
