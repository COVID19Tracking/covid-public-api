{"state":"SC","notes":"As of May 22, South Carolina is reporting specimens tested. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested. As of June 11, South Carolina is separating out PCR and antibody tests; we report the number of PCR tests. Total test numbers were impacted by around 22,000.\nOn July 18, the South Carolina DHEC announced it was transitioning to new reporting systems and that \"there may be incomplete data with significant gaps.\" Though reporting resumed July 28, this resulted in data being carried over at times. We will backfill with the updated numbers when they are available.","covid19Site":"https://scdhec.gov/health/infectious-diseases/viruses/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/monitoring-testing-covid-19","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://www.scdhec.gov/infectious-diseases/viruses/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/sc-demographic-data-covid-19","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://scdhec.gov/infectious-diseases/viruses/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19","twitter":"@scdhec","covid19SiteOld":"https://scdhec.gov/health/infectious-diseases/viruses/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19","name":"South Carolina","fips":"45","pui":"","pum":false}
