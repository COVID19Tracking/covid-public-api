{"state":"SC","notes":"As of June 11, 2020, South Carolina reports PCR tests separately from antibody tests. Total test numbers were reduced by around 22,000 as a result of this change. \n\nOn July 18, 2020, South Carolina announced it was transitioning to new reporting systems and that \"there may be incomplete data with significant gaps.\" Though reporting resumed July 28, 2020, this resulted in data being carried over at times. We will backfill with the updated numbers when they are available.\n\nOn August 23, 2020, South Carolina corrected a double-counting of testing numbers from the first of the months Mayâ€“August. This resulted in a significant drop of all aspects of testing-related counts, with **Total PCR tests (specimens)** dropping by approximately 22,000 and total antibody tests dropping by 1,500.\n\nThe most recent date that South Carolina published **Recovered** data was August 25, 2020. We will carry over the data point from that date until new data is available.\n\nNegative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.","covid19Site":"https://scdhec.gov/health/infectious-diseases/viruses/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/monitoring-testing-covid-19","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://www.scdhec.gov/infectious-diseases/viruses/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/sc-demographic-data-covid-19","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://www.scdhec.gov/infectious-diseases/viruses/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/hospital-bed-capacity-covid-19","twitter":"@scdhec","covid19SiteOld":"https://scdhec.gov/health/infectious-diseases/viruses/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Specimens","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"posNeg","pui":"All data","pum":false,"name":"South Carolina","fips":"45"}
