SC,"As of May 22, South Carolina is reporting specimens tested. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested. 

As of June 11, South Carolina is separating out PCR and antibody tests; we report the number of PCR tests. Total test numbers were impacted by around 22,000.

On July 18, the South Carolina DHEC announced it was transitioning to new reporting systems and that ""there may be incomplete data with significant gaps."" Though reporting resumed July 28, this resulted in data being carried over at times. We will backfill with the updated numbers when they are available.

On August 23, the South Carolina DHEC corrected a double-counting of testing numbers from the first of the months May-August. This resulted in a significant drop of all aspects of testing-related counts, with total PCR Tests tests dropping by  ~21k and total antibody tests dropping by ~1.5k.",https://scdhec.gov/health/infectious-diseases/viruses/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/monitoring-testing-covid-19,https://www.scdhec.gov/infectious-diseases/viruses/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/sc-demographic-data-covid-19,https://scdhec.gov/infectious-diseases/viruses/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19,@scdhec,https://scdhec.gov/health/infectious-diseases/viruses/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19,South Carolina,45,,false
