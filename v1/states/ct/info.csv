CT,"Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.

The **Recovered** data point we report for Connecticut reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.

On November 5, 2020, Connecticut released total test numbers lumping antigen and PCR tests alongside separate PCR and antigen counts. Beginning November 6, 2020, while the lumped figure continued to be updated daily in the state's ""Daily Data Report,"" the separated PCR and antigen test counts were not. On Novemeber 10, 2020, we updated the **Total PCR tests (specimens)** number in CT to be the lumped antigen with PCR number reported beginning Novemeber 5th, and we will capture accordingly until separate numbers are provided again.

On November 5, 2020, Connecticut announced that a backlog of roughly 500 cases identified in August-November 2020, would be reported in the totals for November 5, 2020.

On June 24, 2020, Connecticut corrected some errors in its data, resulting in a decrease in **Negative PCR tests (specimens)** (which can be found in our API and CSVs).

On June 18, 2020, Connecticut corrected some errors in its data, resulting in a decrease in **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.

On May 29, 2020, Connecticut hospitalization data changed due to reporting laboratory-confirmed cases only. These changes resulted in a decrease in the numbers for **Ever hospitalized** and **Recovered** (which can be found in our API and CSVs). 

On May 27, 2020, Connecticut deduplicated some of its data, resulting in a decrease in **Cases** and **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.",https://data.ct.gov/coronavirus,https://data.ct.gov/stories/s/q5as-kyim,,,,@ctdph,https://portal.ct.gov/Coronavirus,Specimens,posNeg,posNeg,All data,false,Connecticut,09
