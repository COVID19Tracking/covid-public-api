CT,"Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.On May 27, 2020, Connecticut deduplicated some of its data, resulting in a decrease in **Cases** and **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.

On June 24, 2020, Connecticut corrected some errors in its data, resulting in a decrease in **Negative PCR tests (specimens)** (which can be found in our API and CSVs).

On June 18, 2020, Connecticut corrected some errors in its data, resulting in a decrease in **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.
