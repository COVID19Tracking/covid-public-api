CT,"On May 27, 2020, Connecticut deduplicated some of its data, resulting in a decrease in **Cases** and **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.

On May 29, 2020, Connecticut hospitalization data changed due to reporting laboratory-confirmed cases only. These changes resulted in a decrease in the numbers for **Ever hospitalized** and **Recovered** (which can be found in our API and CSVs). 

On June 18, 2020, Connecticut corrected some errors in its data, resulting in a decrease in **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.

On June 24, 2020, Connecticut corrected some errors in its data, resulting in a decrease in **Negative PCR tests (specimens)** (which can be found in our API and CSVs).

The **Recovered** data point we report for Connecticut reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.",https://data.ct.gov/coronavirus,,,,,@ctdph,https://portal.ct.gov/Coronavirus,Specimens,posNeg,posNeg,Connecticut,09,,false
