Additionally, the data for November 26, 2020 and November 27, 2020 will both be included in the November 27, 2020 update.\n\nOn November 5, 2020, Connecticut released total test numbers lumping antigen and PCR tests alongside separate PCR and antigen counts. Beginning November 6, 2020, while the lumped figure continued to be updated daily in the state's \"Daily Data Report,\" the separated PCR and antigen test counts were not. On Novemeber 10, 2020, we updated the **Total PCR tests (specimens)** number in CT to be the lumped antigen with PCR number reported beginning Novemeber 5th, and we will capture accordingly until separate numbers are provided again.\n\nOn November 5, 2020, Connecticut announced that a backlog of roughly 500 cases identified in August-November 2020, would be reported in the totals for November 5, 2020.\n\nOn June 24, 2020, Connecticut corrected some errors in its data, resulting in a decrease in **Negative PCR tests (specimens)** (which can be found in our API and CSVs).\n\nOn June 18, 2020, Connecticut corrected some errors in its data, resulting in a decrease in **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.\n\nOn May 29, 2020, Connecticut hospitalization data changed due to reporting laboratory-confirmed cases only. These changes resulted in a decrease in the numbers for **Ever hospitalized** and **Recovered** (which can be found in our API and CSVs). \n\nOn May 27, 2020, Connecticut deduplicated some of its data, resulting in a decrease in **Cases** and **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.","covid19Site":"https://data.ct.gov/coronavirus","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://data.ct.gov/stories/s/q5as-kyim","covid19SiteTertiary":null,"covid19SiteQuaternary":null,"covid19SiteQuinary":null,"twitter":"@ctdph","covid19SiteOld":"https://portal.ct.gov/Coronavirus","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits":"Specimens","covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestField":"posNeg","totalTestResultsField":"posNeg","pui":"All data","pum":false,"name":"Connecticut","fips":"09"}
